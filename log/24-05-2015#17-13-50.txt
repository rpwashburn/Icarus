Subject: Battlerage Fixes and QoL Updates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Fixed some problems with mobs hitting other mobs due to the Charm affliction.

 - The NOOGIE emote should work for people who do not have that Battlerage ability.

 - Amnesia will be removed from a mob after either 30 seconds have passed or the mob executes 2-3 attacks.

 - Seafaring Etch should now be working properly again.

 - Battlerage conditional damage abilities that depend on the fear affliction should now be working properly.

 - The Battlerage abilities Harrow, Horrify, Punishment, Regeneration, and Shock should no longer have a balance/equilibrium check.

 - Fledgling Monks should now be able to use the Blast and Scramble Battlerage abilities.

 - You will now receive a message when a specific Battlerage ability comes off cooldown.

 - You can now configure the color of your rage gain notification, your rage fading notification, and the Battlerage cooldown notification with CONFIG COLOUR RAGE_MESSAGES.

 - The CONFIG RAGEGAINMSG option has been renamed to CONFIG RAGEMSG, and is used to toggle the display of rage gain, fade, and cooldown notifications.

 - The total display in the rage gain notification will now include a decimal place for greater precision.

 - When you gain enough rage during a fight to use an ability that you did not previously have enough rage for, the rage gain notification will now include a list of abilities that you now have enough rage to use.

 - All Battlerage abilities now have a shared cooldown of 1 second during which you cannot execute any other Battlerage abilities.

 - When the shared cooldown expires, you will receive a notification (governed by CONFIG RAGEMSG) that will indicate any other Battlerage abilities you can use, dependent on specific ability cooldown and current rage amount.

 - Your rage should now decay 12 seconds after you get balance/equilibrium back from the attack that generated rage.

 - Mobs will no longer shield more frequently than once every 10 seconds.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. There are 3 slippery elms in a group here. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.
You see a single exit leading west.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face.

Mount Nicator.

The wormhole spits you out at the other end.
A melancholy peak.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An instinctual sense of a storm draws your attention to a large shrine. A large, jet-black metal feather is partly imbedded into the ground.

Meticulously crafted from a multitude of large, flexible dragon scales, the exterior of this pack scintillates with shades of electric blue. Large and spacious within, the container is lined with soft, waterproofed cotton and reinforced on the bottom with a thick panel of leather. Two matching, tooled leather straps secure the pack over the shoulders of the owner comfortably, their surfaces decorated with the sinuous images of blue dragons in flight.
