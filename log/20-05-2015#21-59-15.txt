Subject: About the plague
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sapience,

If you look beyond the misinformation and insults in Taraus's post, you'll see two important pieces of information:
- the plan to purge the harbours of Sapience
- the responsibility each of you has to cure your own ships of the plague (and to not spread it further).

The Mariners have already started with those two actions. As the Pirates do not seem to want to cooperate, I urge them to make use of the chalkboard at Captain Maelstrom, so that we are not wasting the rare tangles on the same harbours.

If you see signs of infection in a harbour or on a ship which are not yet listed on the chalkboard at captain Maelstrom, send a message to Bronislav, Kinilan, Oceana or Taraus.

If you have questions about the plague or need help with your ship, feel free to contact me.

Oceana Dawyn,
Head Mariner

Penned by my hand on the 2nd of Scarlatan, in the year 684 AF.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.
You see a single exit leading east.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.
You see a single exit leading east.

Colours you may use are red, blue, purple, green, black, white, grey, orange, gold, and silver.

To switch to using a specific colour of arrow, simply SWITCH <colour>. If you wish to switch back to using undyed arrows, simply do SWITCH NORMAL.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.
You see a single exit leading east.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.
You see a single exit leading east.

There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead. Laertes floats about in a desultory path, his turns punctuated by slow flexes of his heavily foxed covers. An echinacea root has been dropped here. There are 2 pieces of prickly ash bark in a group here.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. There are 2 aurum flakes in a group here. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead. Laertes floats about in a desultory path, his turns punctuated by slow flexes of his heavily foxed covers. An echinacea root has been dropped here. There are 2 pieces of prickly ash bark in a group here.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.

A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. There are 2 aurum flakes in a group here. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead. Laertes floats about in a desultory path, his turns punctuated by slow flexes of his heavily foxed covers. An echinacea root has been dropped here. There are 2 pieces of prickly ash bark in a group here.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. There are 2 aurum flakes in a group here. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead. Laertes floats about in a desultory path, his turns punctuated by slow flexes of his heavily foxed covers. An echinacea root has been dropped here. There are 2 pieces of prickly ash bark in a group here.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand. Taraus Bravi'os is here.
You see a single exit leading east.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.
You see a single exit leading east.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand.
You see a single exit leading east.

(Mudlet Clan): Sanaki says, "Actually, there's one thing I find irritating that you guys might be able to answer, but it's more to do with queueing. I have a basic RSM/Blast keybind that works fine, but because QUEUE REPLACE won't do anything when the queue's empty, I can't find a way to toss the command in the front of the necessary queue without either allowing prepend to bloat my queue size or having it not add at all when I'm off bal/eq but have the queues empty. Mind you, at the moment this needs to be without tracking my queue's contents clientside, I realize that would be a simple fix."

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Alcinae Nithilar, Herald of Iniquity is here.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here.

The man's eyes gaze out from his chiselled face with stony coldness, sweeping slowly across the area as he stands guard.

He wields a pair of masterfully crafted steel broadswords, their blades sharpened to a fine edge that shimmers with reflections of ambient light.

Draped in an elegant robe of midnight blue etched with undecipherable silver symbols, the skeletal frame of this Naxian mistweaver of Targossas hums with vibrant energy, small bolts of light wracking her body. An unruly mass of ash-blonde hair haphazardly frames a face utterly devoid of expression or emotion, and tumbles past the shoulders of a form so still it resembles a living statue. The glacial eyes of this diminutive figure have a wild glaze to them as they observe the immediate vicinity, fervently seeking any foes. Her wrists and lower arms are covered in a plethora of bracelets and bangles. Clumps of a silvery, lead-based metal coat her hands, and her fingers are caked in a gelatinous substance which drips down in fine strands from her claw-like nails. Betraying her sireni heritage, her lips are a rich ruby in colour, and kohl extravagantly lines her eyes.
