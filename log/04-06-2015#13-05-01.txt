Subject: HTML5 client updates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're overjoyed to announce that the beta version of our HTML5 client is now live! In case you missed the previous announce posts, here's a list of the major changes in the new version:

* A complete graphical overhaul.
* A new character information tab, with your afflictions, defences, rage levels, and class-specific information.
* More F-key buttons (7), which will now be automatically populated when you level up. Battlerage abilities on these buttons will highlight when that ability is ready to use.
* Icons for items in your inventory and room.
* HELP files now pop up into multiple windows, allowing numerous files to be read at once.
* All of the UI elements can now be toggled on/off.
* Tabs can now be dragged to different panes, allowing you to customise your layout.
* Right-clicking on a tab will give you the option to unpin it, letting you move and resize the pane.
* You'll now get a notification when you get new communication and that tab isn't active.
* The client will scale based on your screen resolution/device, with presets for tablets and phones.
* Improved network backend, allowing you to use the client in many places where it was previously blocked.

If you're a regular user of our HTML5 client, please be sure to "force" a refresh in your browser to ensure that you've got the up-to-date version! Additionally, if you've got any additional feedback, or encounter any glitches or bugs, please submit them via the "Feedback" tab in the settings window.

Enjoy!

Subject: News system updates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's some fresh new features to the news system that have just been loaded up! Here's the details:

* You no longer need to specify a news article to read next unread post in a section, simply READNEWS <SECTION> to read the next item!

* There is now a message when someone posts a news article in a section you can read. This message can be coloured in CONFIG COLOUR (under News_Messages).

* You will now get a login alert if you have unread news items. This message and the unread message alert are now more highlighted.

Subject: New features from the IDEAs list
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alongside yesterday's news system updates, we've got some more new game features stemming from player-submitted ideas! Here's all the details:

* Illusions (Wand or skill) will now be echoed back to the caster.
* Login notifications about organisational credit sales will now only show if you can (still) purchase credits.
* Clan channels have been split off from CONFIG COLOUR. You can now list them all under CONFIG COLOUR CLANS while still configuring the colours as normal.
* Elections and referendums will now show you which option you voted for.
* CITY GUARD LIST is now sorted by room.
* ALLY PARTY has been added, allowing easy allying of members of your party.
* SHOW BLEEDING now longer has an equilibrium cost.
* Itching powder is now groupable, and will be automatically split from the group when you slip it to someone.
* Tekura endurance costs have been audited and adjusted.
* Telepathy mana/willpower costs have been audited and adjusted.
* Mindprints and the intellect crown now have a more pronounced benefit to mind lock drains.
* Expert Diagnoser trait is no longer stopped by shield.
* CURING PRIORITY INSERT <affliction> <priority> has been added, reducing the number of commands needed to adjust custom curing priorities.

Thanks go out to all of you who take the time to submit IDEAs, BUGs, and other feedback!

Subject: Apparel Contest Winners
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legates,

  It has been sometime since the apparel contest, we have finally picked winners and polished up the items. The selected items:

1) Drodak:    a dark silk shirt of the Legates
2) Medi:      a daemonic raider's helm
3) Taraus: 1) a regimental jacket of crimson sarcenet
           2) dark martial trousers
4) Vum:       spiked dreak leather gloves
5) Zarla:     a dragonscale cloak with silver clasps and hood



Well done and thanks for all the submissions.  The five of you will soon receive 15 credits for your selections.

--------------------------------------

On another note - The Dread Cashe (NW from the Market District) has been restocked with inks, larger groups of minerals, as well as Fiend Zarla's winning Jubilee recipe: 'a saucy skewer of roasted mhun eyes!'  Over the next year or so, we will begin stocking weapons and armour.  Any suggestions of items to sell or if you are interested in helping forge or stock, speak with me.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The hulking form of an armoured grizzly bear looms ominously nearby. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier.
You see a single exit leading west.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings.  Legate Medi is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading west.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An obsidian eye sigil is here. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A gilded pike with the decapitated heads of Kaerius, Jhui, Maccabeus, Manerro, Aetheron, and Byakko has been erected here. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An obsidian eye sigil is here. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A gilded pike with the decapitated heads of Kaerius, Jhui, Maccabeus, Manerro, Aetheron, and Byakko has been erected here. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An obsidian eye sigil is here. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A gilded pike with the decapitated heads of Kaerius, Jhui, Maccabeus, Manerro, Aetheron, and Byakko has been erected here. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Duelist Borivoj is here. He wields a Mhaldorian, steel bastard sword in both hands. Zarla, Fiend of the Inferno is here. Her face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. The Black Dragon Herose's imposing form looms. Drodak, Duelist of the Seven is here, shrouded.

Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. There are 3 corpses of a knight of the King's Guard here. The remains of a young prince Santhrar lie here, badly mutilated and barely recognisable. The corpse of Tsui'zhir lies crumpled beneath the massive, motionless body of a whisper spider. Accompanied by his mount even in death, Maal'ryn Asgarai, Outrider Ascendant, lies here motionless.

There are 3 corpses of a knight of the King's Guard here. The remains of a young prince Santhrar lie here, badly mutilated and barely recognisable. The corpse of Tsui'zhir lies crumpled beneath the massive, motionless body of a whisper spider. Accompanied by his mount even in death, Maal'ryn Asgarai, Outrider Ascendant, lies here motionless. There are 4 corpses of a shambling zombie here. There are 2 corpses of a vicious ghast here. There are 5 corpses of a flesh-eating slug here. There are 9 corpses of an unravelling mummy here. The bony remains of a skeleton lie here.
You see a single exit leading west.
