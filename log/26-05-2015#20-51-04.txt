The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. The hulking form of an armoured grizzly bear looms ominously nearby.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. The Black Dragon Herose's imposing form looms. Legate Medi is here. He wields a soulspear in his left hand and a cavalry shield in his right. The Blue Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms. The Black Dragon Cooper's imposing form looms.

5786h, 5868m, 24060e, 22695w  exckdb---s01:57:35.79--
As the starburst tattoo's shape is codified on the torso of himself and the last of the ink leaves the air, Atalkez pauses for a moment, an admiring look on his face.

As a distant, triumphant roar is heard, the golden light coalesces about Saibel. Her body begins to change, and deform. Her head flattens, as her neck lengthens. Her body grows dramatically as wings sprout from her back, and a massive tail quickly extrudes from what are now her hindquarters.
5786h, 5847m, 24060e, 22682w  exckdb---s01:57:45.78--

5786h, 5907m, 24060e, 22695w  exckdb---s01:57:53.29--
Saibel completes her transformation and, with an ear-splitting roar, throws back her draconic head and screams out her triumph.
5786h, 5907m, 24060e, 22695w  exckdb---s01:57:53.79--
With a low rumbling from deep within her belly, Saibel utters a guttural chant. Her skin ripples as a web of crackling magical energy dances like fire across its surface, settling to solidify into a flexible, translucent shell.

The saucer-sized eyes of Saibel close briefly in ominous concentration.
5786h, 5886m, 24060e, 22695w  exckdb---s01:58:12.35--
You dip your fingers into the cool water of the bowl, willing it to reveal the location of Jhui.

A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the north.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Legate Atalkez al'Dejan is here. The Silver Dragon Sarik's imposing form looms. Emissary Drodak, Thrall of Elazar is here, shrouded. He wields an archaic, steel bastard sword in both hands.

Shops along Silverveil Promenade.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Vigilant, an umbral tiger crouches on his haunches. Here stands a restless mountain eagle, arrogantly surveying his surroundings. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the north.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. The Silver Dragon Sarik's imposing form looms. Zarla, Fiend of the Inferno is here. Her face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. The Blue Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms. The Black Dragon Ruth's imposing form looms. Legate Atalkez al'Dejan is here. Legate Medi is here. He wields a cavalry shield in his right hand. Emissary Drodak, Thrall of Elazar is here, shrouded. He wields an archaic, steel bastard sword in both hands. The Silver Dragon Xinna's imposing form looms.
You see exits leading north, northeast (open door), east (open door), southeast (open door), south (open door), and west.

Approaching the Champions' Bridge (road).
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems.  Assistant Abadon is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Ambassador Rohai Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Hand is here. Aspirant Amik is here. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Caefir Proselyte, Kellonius Setanus-Weltsdown, Holy Lance is riding on a golden gryphon. His features are obscured by a mask. He wields an Azatlani sacrificial knife in his left hand and Matsuhama's morningstar in his right. The Golden Dragon Tesha's imposing form looms.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. The hulking form of an armoured grizzly bear looms ominously nearby. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Emissary Drodak, Thrall of Elazar is here, shrouded. He wields an archaic, steel bastard sword in both hands. The Silver Dragon Xinna's imposing form looms. Legate Atalkez al'Dejan is here. Legate Medi is here. He wields a cavalry shield in his right hand.

The Champions' Bridge.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. A scorching wall of fire stands here, blocking passage to the south.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
Gateway to Targossas.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.
Blackstone military quarter.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. A scorching wall of fire stands here, blocking passage to the south.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.
