A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A Baalzadeen demon towers over you, filling you with dread. There are 3 slippery elms in a group here. Vigilant, an umbral tiger crouches on his haunches. Here stands a restless mountain eagle, arrogantly surveying his surroundings. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here.  Aepas Xa'sai, Herald of Iniquity is here. He wields an imposing, corroded bastard sword in both hands.
