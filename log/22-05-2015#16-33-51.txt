Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Miniature hands clasped patiently, a diminutive homunculus stands here, its features bearing an uncanny resemblance to Proficy. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  Kastiel is here. Scourge Proficy, the Merciful is riding on a stone gargoyle. His features are obscured by a mask. He wields a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his left hand. Legate Atalkez al'Dejan is here. He wields Baleful Edge in his left hand. Commandant Chiam Nithilar is here. The Golden Dragon Hasar's imposing form looms. Aodfionn Wintermourne, Herald of Redemption is here. He wields Conquering Dawn, an aurulent broadsword in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Aurora in his right.

A flake of stannum rests on the ground here, gleaming a dull silver. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. A small red hawthorn berry has been dropped here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

Approaching the Champions' Bridge (road).
Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Miniature hands clasped patiently, a diminutive homunculus stands here, its features bearing an uncanny resemblance to Proficy. Muscles rippling beneath his grey coat, a noble destrier stands tall here, mane draped over his long neck. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. A daemonic ice wyvern is here, her bloodshot eyes flitting disturbingly around. Coiled upon the ground, an emerald tree snake silently tastes the air. There are 2 sticks of sugarcane in 2 groups here.  Scourge Proficy, the Merciful is riding on a stone gargoyle. His features are obscured by a mask. He wields a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his left hand. Curator Carmain Nithilar, Vindicator of Faith is riding on Azaiza, a daemonic wyvern. He wields a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his right hand. Legate Atalkez al'Dejan is here. Legate Medi is here. He wields a morning star in his right hand.

The Champions' Bridge.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. A flake of stannum rests on the ground here, gleaming a dull silver. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. A small red hawthorn berry has been dropped here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
Gateway to Targossas.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve.
Blackstone military quarter.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
