A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground.

A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face.

Subject: Crafters' Fair
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail,

The Asterian Restoration is proud to announce the inaugural Crafters' Fair, a gathering of individuals united through the art of crafting.

Whether new talent or industry veteran, any interested tailors, jewellers and cooks will be able to showcase their creativity in their trade through displaying their wares on provided carts and participating in key events such as a fashion show, a cooking demonstration, or a cooking competition.

Of these, the fashion show is undoubtedly the highlight of the event as tailors and jewellers will be able to collaborate to create an outfit that best fits the theme 'Nobles and Adventurers'. Challenge yourself by working with a partner and spur each other to new creative heights.

Chefs will have their opportunity to shine as well with the reveal of a mystery box, which will contain ingredients and recipes that the cooks must use to create brand new dishes for a given theme that will be announced with the delivery of the boxes.

Members of the public may seize the chance to watch the masters in action and speak to them about their methods and inspiration, explore business opportunities, and be the first to purchase items from new collections and recipes. Your opinion has a voice: public votes will determine the winners of the various competitions, so come and support your favourite tradespeople.

Be on the lookout for posters placed up around the various gathering areas with details of the event. Crafters should direct their expressions of interest or questions to myself as early as possible, particularly for the fashion show, as we will have to pair the designers by random selection.

We say that knowledge transcends all boundaries; in the same vein, creativity knows no allegiance. Set aside your differences and join us in this celebration of craft to cultivate new talent and reinvigorate the creative realm.

Subject: Sermon on the Natures of Light and Darkness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings everybody,

Roughly five days after this upcoming Serenade, I will be presenting my sermon on the natures of Light and Darkness in the gardens of the Brass Lantern Inn.  I humbly request your presence for a time of peaceful discussion and theological debate.  I would ask that all soldiers who wish to attend, including those of Targossas, to stay their blades and join us unarmed to keep martial tensions low.

Transportation and portals will be available upon request, and I will be sending out reminders through public channels.  I implore you to join regardless of your personal convictions - I will be answering questions and will be open to debate following my sermon.

Thank you,
In Their Service,

Penned by my hand on the 21st of Phaestian, in the year 688 AF.

Subject: Aoghinius' misguided beliefs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Aoghinius,

It has come to my attention that you are erroneously declaring a "political victory" for Hashan, following my stepping down
from CIJ leadership. You believe I was "deposed" from leadership, a direct quote from your post to Hashan's boards . I anticipated this sort of imbecilic gloating, and my amusement at your predictability knows no bounds. Allow me to dissuade you from your lunacy.

Hashan attempted rather feebly to blackmail the CIJ, stating that CIJ members would be banned from Hashan if I did not step down. I never once considered these ridiculous demands, and the entire House agreed with me, asking me not to step down. I was truthfully considering stepping down some time before this little attempt at blackmail, but I held on to the leadership position just a while longer, simply to spite you.

I stepped down from CIJ leadership entirely willingly and of my own accord. I was never contested or deposed, nor once asked to consider stepping down by the House. I had the full support of all CIJ members in whatever course I took. I stepped down because I firmly believe in passing the torch when you've finished your job, and you can proudly look at the organization you've built up. Unlike the council you belong to, I do not believe in clinging to power long past the expiration date, and doing absolutely nothing significant or worthwhile during that time. Perhaps it is out of sheer jealousy that you despise me so - in the 20 years I was CIJ leader, I made the House a wildly popular destination for novices and significantly expanded our ranks. Meanwhile two of Hashan's own Houses, the Merchants and the Serpentlords, have long deserted your walls. The rest would be wise to follow their footsteps.

If you could see past your own nose, Aoghinius, you would realize what I say to be true. But of course, you will cling to any shred of "victory" no matter how wrong those claims may be, to boost your ego and continue living in a dream world where you are not puny and insignificant in the grand scheme of things. The CIJ may be a circus, but it is you who is the real clown.

Sincerely,
Aktillum, the Retired Maniacal Despot

Citizens of Sapience,

In an ever shifting political landscape, and in accordance to the Crown's history of cherishing cultural diversity, citizens of Eleusis, Mhaldor, and Targossas in good standing with Hashan shall be allowed the privilege of admittance into its sovereign borders under escort.

This caveat attached to the reopening of our city to these three city-states is a regrettable necessity. While the Crown desires cultural and economic exchange for the benefit of both sides, these city-states yet oppose the Crown for varying reasons. Thus, for the safety and security of the people of Hashan, it must be imposed. It is our hope that one day these measure will no longer be necessary.

It will be up to the good pleasure of the Hashani people whether to grant any individual escort within the city, and your escort shall bear responsibility for you while within our walls. It is our hope that for those wishing to visit the Crown, that relationships will be built which will encourage the relaxation of this program with our fellow city-states.

I bid you all welcome to the Crown of the Ithmia.

In Service to the Crown,
Vayne de Valois

Subject: Crafters' Fair Amendments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail,

After speaking to a wide variety of crafters, we have decided to make some amendments to the events in the Crafters' Fair.

The full list of amendments are placed upon posters in the Crafting Guild at Delos. It is -strongly- urged that all crafters, particularly for the fashion show, review the rules again as some categories have changed.

Relevant details are:

(1) A full outfit for the purposes of the fashion show consists of four [4] tailored items and three [3] jewellery items.

(2) All participants are entitled to ten [10] cart slots, which may be distributed over the three tradeskills. The slots are yours for the duration of the cart's life, and you may change the wares in your slots as you wish.

(3) All items for the fashion show and cooking competition must be brand new and never shown nor sold before the event.

(4) Participants for the fashion show and cooking competition do not have to be present at the fair itself as long as they are able to send in their creations beforehand.

Important dates:

Miraman 689AF - Fashion show pairings will be announced. You may still join after this date but if you require a partner, there is no guarantee there will be one. Those who are both tailors and jewellers will have no trouble.

Ero 689AF - Cooking competition entries will be closed and mystery boxes delivered. Remember that dishes must have their marks hidden to be eligible.

16/17 Miraman 691AF - Date of the actual Fair. Cart wares, fashion show and competition dishes will all need to be submitted to one of the Founders of the Asterian Restoration by this date, especially if you will not be present.

Fashion show designers should all contact Jurixe S. Nithilar in regards to their models and what they will need to do.

As an aside, the Restoration wishes to thank all participating crafters for the overwhelming response and enthusiasm towards the event, as well as for your well-wishes. It is our hope that with your assistance, this fair will be a success. If there are any that wish to contribute donations towards our work, they are always appreciated and can be accepted by any of the Founders: Ellodin Longshanks, Xer Savril, Ruth I'llur and myself.

Regards,

Jurixe S. Nithilar
representing the Asterian Restoration

Subject: Mining and Legions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A MAJOR new system just went in, for player mining. It is, I pretty much guarantee, nothing like what you might expect.

HELP MINING will tell you more. It is a very long help file, so be warned. The system is not as complex as the length of the help file might indicate though - you'll be fine!

This is a really large change in the economy of Achaea and how many of its comms are produced: carbon (new and required to make steel), steel, iron, obsidian, silver, gold, platinum, gems, coal (very important now), bone, elemental ice, and stone.

For the short-term, comm prices in villages will remain the same, but soon, the prices for comms that can be produced via mining are going to go up a lot in price in the villages, and then a week or two after that, the villages will no longer offer comms that can be gotten from mining.

Once that happens, all the mining comms will be completely player-produced. I expect some players who figure out the mining system and are skillful with it to get quite rich, while some are certainly going to lose money mining.

Now, one thing you will want to take note of are the rare minerals that can be produced as a side-product of mining. These 16 minerals have, as of yet, no name. We're going to name them after the first player to discover each kind, though no more than one per player (so if you are the first to discover two kinds, it'll be the second player to discover one of them who gets it named after her).

Good luck! There's a forum thread for discussion on the system here: http://forums.achaea.com/discussion/3864/mining-and-legions

Please note that as per the help file on them, the fact that attacking squads attack at one level below their actual level means that you are literally throwing your poor soldiers' lives away if you use level 1 soldiers in an attack.

You need to actually level up your soldiers by having them guard a working mine in order to get them to level 2, where they can actually do some good in battle.

Subject: Mining and PK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many questions have been asked about mines and how they relate to the PK landscape in Achaea. At this time, we consider  the conflict generated by this game feature to be self-contained. Much like ship-to-ship combat on the seas, an assault on another adventurer's mines or strongholds does not constitute justification to attack that adventurer.

As the mines system settles in, and adventurers are more familiar with the system, we may revisit the possibility of further repercussions from these actions.

Subject: The Sunderlands
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Somewhere below the city of Hashan, a primal force stirred.

Unearthly wails shattered the firmament, enraged beyond perception, and all of Sapience shook as Hashani citizens heard the rabid sounds of scratching and clawing throughout their home.

Cracking and groaning, the earth between the city and the northern Ithmia began to split. Some could not believe what they saw: spectral hands rising from the crevice and clawing at the earth, widening the cracks with inexplicable strength until they became a chasm many hundreds of feet wide.

Then, almost as suddenly as they began, the wails lessened to but a whisper, and an unnerving quietude descended upon the city.

Summary: the Sunderlands now surround Hashan, separating it from the Ithmia.

Subject: The Hashani Renaissance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The breaking of the land around Hashan had brought great uncertainty to the city. A great power lay, now exposed, somewhere far beneath their feet. The leaders of the city agreed that it was their responsibility to both understand and harness this power, but how best to begin on such a path?

Cloistered in the Seneschal's Complex, the regents and House leaders debated for what seemed like hours over what must come next, but at last they came to an agreement. To move forward, they proposed, Hashan would need to step beyond its past. The two great Houses of Hashan must close, so that all resources could combine and be put toward this unified goal. So ended the Spirit Walkers and the Sect of the Black Lotus, and the city of Hashan continued to change: no longer the Crown of the Ithmia, they would now be known as the Court of Shadows.

Several months later, as darkness fell upon the world, the citizens of Hashan gathered at the crossroads of their city's main thoroughfares. In the midst of the crowd stood Damaris, one of the city's most learned elders. Praising the city's strength and perseverance in the prior months, she presented to the city two new Houses, and named the founding members with great pride.

Thus was founded the Somatikos, by Tyamat, Tharvis, Jacen, and Fen; and the Krymenian Academy, by Aoghinius, Vayne, Mannimar, and Ginovianna.


Summary: the Sect of the Black Lotus and Spirit Walkers are no more; Hashan welcomes two new houses: the Somatikos and the Krymenian Academy.

Subject: An Honorary Knighting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail Mhaldor,

This month, Mhaldorians were invited to a ceremony by Mhaldor's Knight Commander, Sir Titonus. The ceremony led to a surprise honorary knighting of one of the individuals present. The event is described below.

Sir Titonus began, "I have asked you all here today, to speak on a matter that is quite close to my heart. The majority of those gathered here today have undoubtedly heard of the long, arduous road to Mhaldorian Knighthood. It is an honorific bestowed upon only those who've achieved excellence in all facets- mind, body and soul. A Knight will conduct themselves in a manner that their actions remain beyond reproach."

At this point, phantoms of Mhaldorian Knights entered the assembly, passing through those in attendance, and sending a grave like chill down their spines. Banners could be seen, flying the arms of the Infernals as well as the Maldaathi. The phantoms began to fall in line, shoulder to shoulder, encircling the statue of Lord Kaelin, all coming to a stop with a unified stomp and snapping themselves to rigid attention.

Sir Titonus continued, "A Knight knows not only themselves, but the world around them, and can bend it to their will."

Shimmering to life, the silhouette of a man bent over an arcane altar appeared. Scarcely visible, his brow knit in concentration as he conjoured his fell magic. Wavering tendrils of red and black manifested on the surface of the dais, growing larger and brighter until man and shrine were both wreathed in a sinister conflagration.

"A Knight knows how to light the fire in their comrades hearts. That they will eagerly march onto the very end of existence with pride and the knowledge that a Knight will lead them to victory."

Screams of war preceded the appearance of a shadowed soldier, his armour dented and his face caked with dirt and blood. His right arm was raised defiantly over his head, a white knuckled grip on a blood-soaked sword. The image quickly zoomed out, showing the soldier leading a company of warriors in a battle charge over a firey, corpse strewn field.

"A Knight will be a leader among his peers. Devoting themselves entirely to their organizations, shedding desires of personal glory or wealth, to the betterment of the collective."

Turning quickly on their heels, the phantoms began walking, moving into position forming a razor sharp line before the assembly. With their white, blank eyes burning a hole through those assembled, the Knights again snapped to attention, their collective gaze falling upon only one.

"There is an individual amongst you today who exemplifies all these qualities, and more. We have shared in victories, as well as defeats. And through it all, they have always risen to the challenge to take the fight to our enemies. They have displayed Honour, both among us, as well as when engaging our enemies on the field. They have served the Master as well as Mhaldor in a manner that has caught the attention of more than a few of us."

All at once and with a single movement, the collected Knights slowly brought their right hands to their eyebrows in a formal salute.

"As His Knight Commander within the Baelgrim Fortress, I have judged your service. I have judged your honour. I have judged your loyalty to the Master and to Mhaldor. I have judged your dedication to your fellow citizens, as well the ferocity that you meet those who would wish to remove the air from our lungs, blood from our veins and this very ground beneath our feet. I have judged you completely."

Slowly scanning the crowd Sir Titonus's weathered eyes momentarily locked with those of the assembled Mhaldorians before moving on.

"And I have found you worthy."

Sir Titonus then looked to Lord Marshal Hasar and said, "If you would take to a knee, Lord Marshal."

Hasar kneeled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long has the army of Evil fought, conquered, and destroyed those forces arrayed against our Master in the world. Our coffers grow to overflowing with the spoils of our innumerable victories within the supposed strongholds of our enemies. It's time for that gold to flow to our soldiers.

Beginning with the coming Sarapin of 689, we will begin rewarding excellence on the battlefield. Any time a raid is sanctioned and a tank is placed within an enemy city, it will be an eligible battle for this system. After the fighting ends, all participating soldiers who are Dynamis or above may tell or message the Lord Marshal with their recommendation for an exemplary individual from that engagement. Recommendations may not be for oneself, the Lord Marshal, or the Tyrannus, all other individuals are eligible.

Recommendations will be tallied over the course of the year, and earnings from sanctioned raids will be distributed to the most recommended individuals ranked as follows:

 1st: 60% of war spoils
 2nd: 25% of war spoils
 3rd: 15% of war spoils

Individuals who receive first place rewards during a year will be ineligible to take first the following year, and will receive second place rewards if they receive the most recommendations that year.

Please refer to CHELP SPOILSOFWAR to review this information at a later date.

Subject: Mining
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail Mhaldor,

We continue to branch out and begin to dominate the world on new fronts. Now, our legions extract minerals from the earth, to hoard or profit, whilst stealing the same from our enemies. As many Mhaldorians take up mining, there are some things to note:

1. I am attempting to provide iron at a good rate in Mhaldor's commodity market. The exact rate will be adjusted based on the market, but the idea is to provide Mhaldorians with an easy means of acquiring iron to construct new mines, while also making some gold for the city. Please look to our commodity store for your iron first, should you find the price satisfactory, to help serve this purpose.

2. Mhaldorians will not invade the mines of other Mhaldorians. We will assist each other, or act alone, but we will not fight amongst ourselves. Invading the mines of heathens, however, is encouraged.

3. I have an interest in some of the rare minerals acquired through mining, and I am sure other Mhaldorians do, as well. Given that these minerals may provide us with an advantage in military and other endeavours, I would suggest they be sold first to Mhaldorians, particularly the most coveted ones. Be wary of their power when offering them up to heathens on the market.

If you wish to mine, you likely have citymates able to assist in supplying you with the commodities for a good price, in addition to buying from our city's commodity market. Let us further dominate in this new endeavour, building our own strength and bringing suffering upon those who oppose us.

Thralls.

Greetings from your Executioner. This accordance heralds the beginning of a competition I would like to see implemented through many years to come. The details are below.

Beginning at the turn of the new year, the competition will run for one year. It is a competition of Strength, Skill and Assassination.

Solo Assassination:  10 points

Duo Assassination:   3 points*

Group Kills:   1 point

Bonus Points
============
- If in enemies' city:  +2 points **
- If in Annwyn/UW:  +1 point
- If Unlikely Odds:  +1 point ***

For the spirit of this tournament, Defense of the Master's city will not count towards the competition. Kills within the walls of Mhaldor will not count towards obtaining victory.

(Notes)
* - Points will be applied to both participants if they are both in the House. If the partner is Insidi, no additional points are awarded, you receive three (3).

** - Only applies to Solo and Duo assassinations. Raids in enemy cities (3 or more) will not procure these bonus points.

*** - Only applies to Solo and Duo assassinations, the assassinated targets must be no less than 50% of your might. The assassin will receive +1 point per additional competent warrior present when the assassination takes place.

	Example: Cresil and Xinna fight Targossas in Eastern Reaches. Cresil and Xinna vs Aelios, Halos, Antidas, and Brogeta.
Cresil kills Aelios and Halos, Xinna kills Antidas and Brogeta. Each will receive 6 points (3 per kill at Duo rank) + 2 points for two additional enemies over their own numbers. Both will receive 8 points.

To receive your points, you must contact myself with a message in the following format:

In the event of a tie, the reward will be split between the two, each receiving a Housefavour as needed. Any malcontent or collusions to create a tie will be dealt with in a manner befitting a traitor to the Master's cause. I will seek your death personally.

Legates,

The past two years have seen 266 heathen shrines splintered solely by Legates. That is an average of over eleven (11) shrines per month! We have certainly wrought much suffering upon the heathens.

In addition, dozens of shrines and over 56 million essence offered to the Master!

I will begin awarding credits to all of the eligible participants.  Those who earned more than ten (10) points in the contest will be noted here as well.

Scourge Proficy - 486
Minister Crixos - 349
Commandant Chiam - 320
Crusher Kelandra - 31
Duelist Argathian - 20
Duelist Entaro - 15
Sir Hasar - 12
Sir Titonus - 12
Tyrannus Xinna - 11

After years of effort Scourge Proficy has emerged as the most prolific Legate. He single handedly spintered 137 heathen shrines!  Two housefavours from Legates above HR10 will be awarded to him.

Both Commandant Chiam and Minister Crixos proved themselves to be a force that no heathen will soon forget.  Given the close nature of these scores and the large gap between any other Legate both the Commandant and Minister will  receive one housefavour from Legates above HR10.  Minister Crixos' favour will be delayed and awarded immediately upon attainment of HR7.

If anyone is interested in the breakdown between the three categories: raising, defiling, and offering then you may message me directly.

In service,

Greetings, Thralls.

I come before the young of this house and present you all with a challenge.

Starting from this post until the end of the year, any young Thrall may approach me and name a mineral.  Your task is to explain exactly what that mineral does once consumed, what aflictions it may cure and anything else they think would be relevant in effective curing.  I will award those who give me correct answers a bunch of said minerals, ranging from 10-100 depending on how thorough an answer you give me.

The road to Strength is long and ardious, and knowing exactly what you need to survive and why you need it is just the first step on this road.  Study hard, and reap the rewards.

In Strength,
Duelist Entaro

24.1 Mines and mining

Mining is a system unlike any other in Achaea. It is not about you - the
adventurer - heading out into the mountains and swinging a pickaxe yourself.
Goodness, no. You are way too awesome for that.

SUMMARY
--------------
Since this is a somewhat involved system, we'll start with a summary of how it
works. For further information on the related mining topics, please see
HELP 24 for a list of mining-related HELP files.

1. You now have a Legion, which is composed of squads of two overarching
   types: Mining and Soldier. However, until you purchase squads to go in it,
   your Legion is empty.

2. Hire yourself, at minimum, one mining squad for your Legion. You may also
   want to hire soldier squads for protection. That's up to you.

3. Go find a Mining Camp.

4. PROSPECT within 6 rooms of the mining camp to see if there are any lodes to
   be found in that room.

5. Lode types are of 'raw commodities' like iron ore, silver ore, raw bone,
   impure ice (See: HELP RAW COMMODITIES).

6. Assuming there isn't another mine already built in that room, you can now
   CONSTRUCT a mine of small, medium, or large sizes. The mine's size plays
   into how much it will cost to operate and how many squad members can be put
   in it at once.

7. Enter the mine.

8. Deploy your squads. The mining squads will immediately set to work on the
   lode.

9. As they extract the raw comms, they will go into the mine's storage. You
   can CLAIM STORAGE at any time while in the mine in order to get those raw
   comms into your inventory, at a cost of 1500-4000 gold.

24.1 Mines and mining

Mining is a system unlike any other in Achaea. It is not about you - the
adventurer - heading out into the mountains and swinging a pickaxe yourself.
Goodness, no. You are way too awesome for that.

SUMMARY
--------------
Since this is a somewhat involved system, we'll start with a summary of how it
works. For further information on the related mining topics, please see
HELP 24 for a list of mining-related HELP files.

1. You now have a Legion, which is composed of squads of two overarching
   types: Mining and Soldier. However, until you purchase squads to go in it,
   your Legion is empty.

2. Hire yourself, at minimum, one mining squad for your Legion. You may also
   want to hire soldier squads for protection. That's up to you.

3. Go find a Mining Camp.

4. PROSPECT within 6 rooms of the mining camp to see if there are any lodes to
   be found in that room.

5. Lode types are of 'raw commodities' like iron ore, silver ore, raw bone,
   impure ice (See: HELP RAW COMMODITIES).

6. Assuming there isn't another mine already built in that room, you can now
   CONSTRUCT a mine of small, medium, or large sizes. The mine's size plays
   into how much it will cost to operate and how many squad members can be put
   in it at once.

7. Enter the mine.

8. Deploy your squads. The mining squads will immediately set to work on the
   lode.

9. As they extract the raw comms, they will go into the mine's storage. You
   can CLAIM STORAGE at any time while in the mine in order to get those raw
   comms into your inventory, at a cost of 1500-4000 gold.

(Market): Jonesey says, "Buying bucket handle, whistle bottom, horn left and right, globe middle and icicle middle."
5786h, 5843m, 24060e, 22683w  exckdb---s21:46:24.02--
Xinna steps out of her iron ore mine.
Your enhanced senses inform you that Xinna has entered Granite Hills nearing the sea at your location.
5786h, 5909m, 24060e, 22683w  exckdb---s21:46:50.02--
[File continued via MORE]

10. Every time you CLAIM STORAGE, the adventurer, if any, who controls the
   stronghold in the mining camp will get a bonus of 5% of the raw comms
   claimed.

11. You can use your soldier squads to attack other people's mines and
   strongholds, capturing them if you succeed in wiping out any soldier squads
   inside them.

12. Your mining squads may occasionally dig up a rare mineral that can grant
   (usually temporary) special powers (See: HELP RARE MINERALS).

13. When the mine is depleted, it'll collapse about 10 minutes later,
   transferring squads back to your Legion as well as moving anything in
   storage to your inventory.

14. You must now convert your raw comms into normal, usable comms. Every
    mining camp has a refinery for this purpose (See: HELP RAW MINERALS for
    more information)

15. There are rankings showing which adventurers have mined the most of each
   comm, and a global ranking showing the most accomplished miners. There's
   also a global ranking based on the total number of days an adventurer has
   controlled Strongholds for. RANKINGS MINING, RANKINGS MINING <comm> and
   RANKINGS STRONGHOLDS.

You find a lode by PROSPECTing the room you're in. One important thing to note
is that after a room's lode gets emptied, another lode will eventually appear
there. If you use the PROSPECT command in a room with a mine already in it, it
will tell you what size of mine there is there, the comm type it's mining for,
the lode size, and the approximate amount that has been mined out of the lode.
It will also tell you how many times storage on the mine has been claimed,
approximately. Note that prospecting costs 100 gold each time you do it.

When you find a lode, it will be of small, medium large, or huge sizes, which
correspond to how many raw comms can be extracted before that lode is emptied.
Lode sizes range from 1500-6000.

When you find a lode you like, it's time to establish a mine:

24.1 Mines and mining

Mining is a system unlike any other in Achaea. It is not about you - the
adventurer - heading out into the mountains and swinging a pickaxe yourself.
Goodness, no. You are way too awesome for that.

SUMMARY
--------------
Since this is a somewhat involved system, we'll start with a summary of how it
works. For further information on the related mining topics, please see
HELP 24 for a list of mining-related HELP files.

1. You now have a Legion, which is composed of squads of two overarching
   types: Mining and Soldier. However, until you purchase squads to go in it,
   your Legion is empty.

2. Hire yourself, at minimum, one mining squad for your Legion. You may also
   want to hire soldier squads for protection. That's up to you.

3. Go find a Mining Camp.

4. PROSPECT within 6 rooms of the mining camp to see if there are any lodes to
   be found in that room.

5. Lode types are of 'raw commodities' like iron ore, silver ore, raw bone,
   impure ice (See: HELP RAW COMMODITIES).

6. Assuming there isn't another mine already built in that room, you can now
   CONSTRUCT a mine of small, medium, or large sizes. The mine's size plays
   into how much it will cost to operate and how many squad members can be put
   in it at once.

7. Enter the mine.

8. Deploy your squads. The mining squads will immediately set to work on the
   lode.

9. As they extract the raw comms, they will go into the mine's storage. You
   can CLAIM STORAGE at any time while in the mine in order to get those raw
   comms into your inventory, at a cost of 1500-4000 gold.

5786h, 5779m, 24060e, 22681w  exckdb---s21:50:06.53--
[File continued via MORE]

10. Every time you CLAIM STORAGE, the adventurer, if any, who controls the
   stronghold in the mining camp will get a bonus of 5% of the raw comms
   claimed.

11. You can use your soldier squads to attack other people's mines and
   strongholds, capturing them if you succeed in wiping out any soldier squads
   inside them.

12. Your mining squads may occasionally dig up a rare mineral that can grant
   (usually temporary) special powers (See: HELP RARE MINERALS).

13. When the mine is depleted, it'll collapse about 10 minutes later,
   transferring squads back to your Legion as well as moving anything in
   storage to your inventory.

14. You must now convert your raw comms into normal, usable comms. Every
    mining camp has a refinery for this purpose (See: HELP RAW MINERALS for
    more information)

15. There are rankings showing which adventurers have mined the most of each
   comm, and a global ranking showing the most accomplished miners. There's
   also a global ranking based on the total number of days an adventurer has
   controlled Strongholds for. RANKINGS MINING, RANKINGS MINING <comm> and
   RANKINGS STRONGHOLDS.

You find a lode by PROSPECTing the room you're in. One important thing to note
is that after a room's lode gets emptied, another lode will eventually appear
there. If you use the PROSPECT command in a room with a mine already in it, it
will tell you what size of mine there is there, the comm type it's mining for,
the lode size, and the approximate amount that has been mined out of the lode.
It will also tell you how many times storage on the mine has been claimed,
approximately. Note that prospecting costs 100 gold each time you do it.

When you find a lode, it will be of small, medium large, or huge sizes, which
correspond to how many raw comms can be extracted before that lode is emptied.
Lode sizes range from 1500-6000.

When you find a lode you like, it's time to establish a mine:

[File continued via MORE]
CONSTRUCT <small/medium/large> MINE
 - Small mine  : 60 squad members (max. 40 miners)
 - Medium mine : 200 squad members (max. 120 miners)
 - Large mine  : 480 squad members (max. 200 miners)

Mines have costs to establish, of course, and these comms must be in your
inventory:
 - Small mine  : 75 iron and 180 wood
 - Medium mine : 140 iron and 350 wood
 - Large mine  : 230 iron and 650 wood

Next, you will:

ENTER MINE
 - Only the owner of a mine can enter it via the entrance.
 - You'll now be in your mine, which will have a few rooms.
 - LEAVE MINE will leave it, as long as you're in the first room in your mine.

Now you'd DEPLOY SQUADS (See: HELP LEGIONS).

You'll pretty much always want to put your mining squads in the final room of
the mine. Your soldier squads could be placed anywhere, but you'll want to
understand how squad combat works (See: HELP MINING ASSAULT).

If you don't deploy any mining squads within 10 minutes, your mine will
collapse, killing you if you're in it (but not killing any squads in it - they
will return to your Legion).

While your mining squads are in the mine, they will be working away, producing
raw comms that will go into your mine's storage. Each raw comm type takes a
different amount of time for a single miner to produce, and the more miners
you have, the faster the mine will produce comms.


Mine and Stronghold Storage
---------------------------
Where do the raw comms that your mining squads produce go? Into your mine's
storage.

You can see what's in the storage of your mine or stronghold at any time

you're in it by doing SEE STORAGE.

In order to get them out of storage and into your inventory, you need to be
in your mine and CLAIM STORAGE. This will transfer, five minutes later, the
raw comms in your mine's storage to your inventory. In a small mine this costs
1500 gold. In a medium mine it's 2500, and in a large mine, 4000 gold.

Your mining squads will continue working the mine until you recall them or
there's nothing left in the lode, at which point your squads will return to
your Legion and the mine will collapse. Don't be in the mine when it
collapses.

Anything in your mine's storage in storage will be transferred to your
inventory.


Mine Costs
----------
Aside from the upfront costs in iron and wood (see above) to establish a mine,
there are ongoing costs. These costs will come out of your bank accounts, so
you must be sure to have enough gold in your accounts to cover the costs,
which are as follows:

 - Every Achaean day, a small mine will cost 200 gold, a medium mine 350 gold,
   and a large mine 600 gold.
 - 5 gold/Achaean day for every individual miner. There are, in an uninjured
   squad, 20 miners to a squad. Soldiers cost nothing on an ongoing basis.

If the system tries to take money out of your bankacccounts and there's none
there, the mine will be destroyed and all comms in it lost, though your squads
will be returned to your Legion.

Make sure you keep enough gold in your bank accounts to cover these costs!
