PUBLIC NEWS #19707                                      (07/23/2015 at 22:58)

Subject: Crafters' Fair updates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail,

The pairings for the Crafters' Fair fashion show and the parcels for the mystery box cooking competition have now all been delivered. If you were under the impression that you had registered for either of these events and have not received your pairing or parcel, notify myself posthaste.

We will no longer be accepting entries for the cooking competition. Crafters may still register for the fashion show if you possess both tailoring and jewellery licenses, but not if you only have a single license as we cannot guarantee any matches.

For the fashion show pairings, it is important that both parties agree on one (1) model to represent both your creations; you will be showcasing one outfit, not clothes on one model and jewellery on the next.

All crafters may refer to the silver journal in the Crafting Guild at Delos for instructions on any of the categories, or speak to any of the Founders.

Good luck, and we hope to see the fruits of your labour on the 16th of Miraman 691AF when the Fair officially begins.

Regards,

Jurixe S. Nithilar
representing the Asterian Restoration

Subject: Eleusian Ban Reinstated
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citizens of the Village of Eleusis,

Harkening back to the ever shifting political landscape of Sapience, I regret to inform you that all citizens, whether previously in good standing with the Court or not, are henceforth banned from entering the sovereign territory of Hashan until further notice. Any Eleusian citizen who violates this edict will be immediately branded an enemy of the Court and dealt with accordingly.

This policy has been set forth in reaction to the government of Eleusis once again failing to honour their words and assaulting the shrines of Lord Twilight in the Sunderlands. As long as such mendacious leadership as Alrena Winterheart rules the village, we will be unable to revoke this edict.

In Service to the Court,
Vayne de Valois

Citizens of the City of Hashan,


I am ok with this.

Your existence is but a temporary thing. In the aeons of time your urban constructs will crumble and fade away as dust in the wind.

Until then, as long as you live opposed to Nature, I and others with me will visit your city when we please. To knock down the walls and homes you build for yourselves, to slaughter your guards and soldiers and any others who would stand against Nature, rather than with Her.


In service of Nature,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings,

It would seem my colleague Vayne forgot a choice detail about our decision in his post. Two months from this post, all citizens of Eleusis will be enemied to the Court. It matters not what their rank is, it matters not if they are soldiers, it matters not how old they are, all shall be branded an enemy.
This enemy status will remain until such a time they are either no longer citizens of Eleusis, or the Eleusian government is almost fully replaced.

Kind regards,

Tharvis Dicondron

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two big changes:

1) There's no longer any limit on # of squads per room in a mine or stronghold.

2) The costs to establish a mine on a lode are now scaled to the remaining % of the lode, so if a lode is 80% mined out, it will only cost you 20% of the normal cost to build it.

We (all of us at Iron Realms, and Vadimuses) are pleased that we were able to make this happen and think it's a win for everybody involved, especially you guys.

I'm not going to put all the details up here, but if you're interested in the schedule we worked out, it's here in a forum post: http://forums.achaea.com/discussion/3918/svo-is-going-free-open-source

Subject: Globe updates!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The time is here! Globes of Shifting Continents have been refreshed with some exciting new wares! Here's all of the details of the new items:

* Two new minipets! You could find a wiry polecat kit or a gangly ibis in your globe!

* Our major new addition is a bloodstained shard of enamel - what is this, you ask? Well, its a reagent to create and upgrade a special item that's only available for the duration of this promotion.

When you get your first shard, you can SLICE PALM WITH <shard> to create a very special item. Your blood will mix with the enamel shard to form a locket with your picture inside.  This locket, and the portrait inside, will be linked to you, bestowing a variety of special powers. Additional powers will unlock as you obtain additional shards, then FUSE <shard> INTO <locket>, upgrading the portrait and the powers.

There is a cost to these powers though: The locket must be fuelled by your very being. Once every 24 RL hours, you can CARESS <locket> to imbue it with your blood. The varying skills will use a portion (or all) of the stored blood power.

There's 20 levels of locket - here's a list of the powers that come with each level:
Level 1:  Creation of the locket.
Level 2:  The locket no longer decays.
Level 3:  SOLICIT LOCKET FOR IMMORTALITY - Death is suspended for 5 seconds after you die (** See note below **) (100% power usage)
Level 4:  The locket now resets to you.
Level 5:  SPIN LOCKET - changes the appearance of your locket to one of 7 different themed versions. Usable once per day.
Level 6:  Immortality now lasts 10 seconds.
Level 7:  SOLICIT LOCKET FOR REST - Draw your fatigue into your portrait, refreshing your tiredness. (33% power usage)
Level 8:  SOLICIT LOCKET FOR SATIATION - Trade satiation with your portrait, quenching your hunger. (33% power usage)
Level 9:  Immortality now lasts for 15 seconds.
Level 10: SOLICIT LOCKET FOR SOBRIETY - Cleanse yourself of all alcoholic effects. (Does not work in drinking contests.) (33% power usage)
Level 11: Caressing the locket now has a lower cost.
Level 12: Immortality now lasts 20 seconds.
Level 13: SOLICIT LOCKET FOR ENDURANCE - Gain 5% of your maximum endurance. (50% power usage)
Level 14: SOLICIT LOCKET FOR WILLPOWER - Gain 5% of your maximum willpower. (50% power usage)
Level 15: Immortality now lasts 25 seconds.
Level 16: SOLICIT LOCKET FOR RAGE - Store/retrieve your rage in your portrait. (33% power usage)
Level 17: SOLICIT LOCKET FOR TATTOOS - Freeze your tattoos on your portrait, preventing automatic fading for an hour. (33% power usage)
Level 18: Immortality now lasts 30 seconds.
Level 19: Soliciting your locket for willpower or endurance now imbues you with 10% of your maximum stat..
Level 20: Immortality will no longer kill you, should you reach your full health and mana before immortality fades.

** Note **
* Death is only suspended in cases where you normally die to damage.

Subject: Lockets and "immortality"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since there seems to be some confusion about the immortality power, this is just a quick clarification post about it!

It's not true "immortality", more of a slight postponement of the inevitable. Here's what happens with the immortality power active:
   1. You receive a non-instakill attack that brings you to 0 health.
   2. The ability fires, giving you and people in the room a message that it fires.
   3. Your health is set to a very low level, any afflictions and effects on your person remain.
   4. You continue the fight as normal until either:
      a) Receive an attack that brings you to 0 health again.
      b) You get instakilled.
      c) The immortality power fails.
      d) You heal up to full health/mana (with a level 20 locket only).

A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. Unfurling from within a thick, rolling fog, the majestic forms of two Immortal men captured in red bloodsteel are here. Peering around with nervously darting eyes, Maric crouches quietly here. A steel-reinforced pillory of heavy oak stands here, designed to imprison an offender by the head and the hands. A feral humgii snarls angrily while pulling at its leash. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A scarlet scroll made of leathery skin sits rolled up here. A grizzled old orc squats here barking commands in his guttural tongue. A vast pyramid of skulls occupies most of the surrounding space in this area. A cast iron trough of bubbling tar is here emitting a noxious smell. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A ragged orc slave stands here with his shoulders hunched.

A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the southwest.

There are 3 magnesium chips in 3 groups here. There are 3 potash crystals in 3 groups here. Observing his surrounds with a piercing gaze, a ferocious red manticore paces back and forth.  Seragorn Rousseau is here, shrouded. His features are obscured by a mask. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand.

Pestilent Way.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Only through Oppression and Suffering can true strength be achieved." A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. Unfurling from within a thick, rolling fog, the majestic forms of two Immortal men captured in red bloodsteel are here. Peering around with nervously darting eyes, Maric crouches quietly here. A steel-reinforced pillory of heavy oak stands here, designed to imprison an offender by the head and the hands. A feral humgii snarls angrily while pulling at its leash. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A scarlet scroll made of leathery skin sits rolled up here. A grizzled old orc squats here barking commands in his guttural tongue. A vast pyramid of skulls occupies most of the surrounding space in this area. A cast iron trough of bubbling tar is here emitting a noxious smell. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the southwest. Inverted wings pointed skyward, Lethe, a great white bat considers her dominion.  The Golden Dragon Ethoas' imposing form looms. Atalkez Al'Jafri, Blade of the North is here.

Circle of Pain.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. A cast iron trough of bubbling tar is here emitting a noxious smell. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. A burly, wide set mhun works frantically here.

The soul of Uragor roams the land, bodiless. Ainly Sar'vet, Magna Araneae is here, shrouded. His features are obscured by a mask. He wields a darkbow in both hands.

Narrowing your eyes, you squint off toward the northwest.
Pestilent Way.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Only through Oppression and Suffering can true strength be achieved." A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. Unfurling from within a thick, rolling fog, the majestic forms of two Immortal men captured in red bloodsteel are here. Peering around with nervously darting eyes, Maric crouches quietly here. A steel-reinforced pillory of heavy oak stands here, designed to imprison an offender by the head and the hands. A feral humgii snarls angrily while pulling at its leash. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground.

A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the southwest.

Pestilent Way.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Only through Oppression and Suffering can true strength be achieved." Unfurling from within a thick, rolling fog, the majestic forms of two Immortal men captured in red bloodsteel are here. Peering around with nervously darting eyes, Maric crouches quietly here. A steel-reinforced pillory of heavy oak stands here, designed to imprison an offender by the head and the hands. A feral humgii snarls angrily while pulling at its leash. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A scarlet scroll made of leathery skin sits rolled up here. A grizzled old orc squats here barking commands in his guttural tongue. A vast pyramid of skulls occupies most of the surrounding space in this area. A cast iron trough of bubbling tar is here emitting a noxious smell. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the southwest. Observing his surrounds with a piercing gaze, a ferocious red manticore paces back and forth. Inverted wings pointed skyward, Lethe, a great white bat considers her dominion. A mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Seragorn Rousseau is here, shrouded. His features are obscured by a mask. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand. Mizik Corten, Keeper of the Crumbling Throne is here. He wields a vorpal longsword in his left hand and a lightweight notched buckler in his right. The Golden Dragon Ethoas' imposing form looms.

From   : Taraus Bravi'os
To     : Everyone
Subject: The peak of the Spire!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After a long, grueling series of battles, our combatants have finally finished Climbing the Spire.

One warrior has risen victorious, ascending to the heights - offer your congratulations to Sir Hasar Lichlord, who stands at the peak as the Champion of Baelgrim!

Undefeated until the very end, Tyrannus Xinna Dracrotalus certainly bears honour as the second to the title.

I would like to extend my personal congratulations to all the competitors, all proving once more that the Mhaldorian soldier that adheres to the Truths sets himself head and shoulders above all others on the battlefield.

You slip away to the north and successfully evade your pursuers.
Nefarious Way.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the south. Inverted wings pointed skyward, Lethe, a great white bat considers her dominion. A mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro.  Mizik Corten, Keeper of the Crumbling Throne is here. He wields a darkbow in both hands. Tyrannus Xinna Dracrotalus, Dread Legate is here. Her features are obscured by a mask. She wields an elegant Mhaldorian rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right.

Gripped by the cold embrace of death, you succumb to the darkness...

0h, 5789m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:22:43.76--
Eerie blackness surrounds you; no light penetrates the endless gloom. Only a faint wind makes itself known, drifting across your beaten body with a silken touch.
0h, 5789m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:22:43.85--
With each caress of the persistent breeze your senses heighten, and a chill begins to spread through you with increasing intensity. You give a violent shiver as the cold envelops your very soul, crushing your resolve with a merciless bite.

At once, the unmistakable presence of death overwhelms all else, and your stomach heaves: the stench of decay is ever-present, relentless, and unforgiving. Tears run down your face as the odour assails the senses, and instinctively you wipe them away.
0h, 5639m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:23:03.94--
With one hand pressed against your nose to bar the smell, you cautiously raise the other, warily feeling into the darkness with outstretched fingers. Emptiness greets you; the world is a bleak, unknown wasteland, and your ears strain for any semblance of sound.

Far in the distance echoes the faint rush of water. At once, the unbearable need to quench an eternal thirst swells within you, and you turn toward the source. Without thought you submit to the harsh environs, stumbling across the uneven terrain beneath your feet.
0h, 5489m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:23:23.97--
Time becomes immeasurable as you struggle onward through desolation. Moments pass, first crawling, then racing without restraint. The terrain shifts and alters beneath your feet with each hazardous step. Silently you persist, eagerly moving toward satiation with unrivalled desperation.

The tantalising sound of running water roars in your ears, now deafening in its sweet euphony. Lured onward by the beckoning current, you draw closer, certain your destination lies mere inches from your grasping reach.
0h, 5339m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:23:44.02--
Blinding light flashes before you as a gleaming scythe cuts through the air, the blade halting inches before your drained countenance. "Be still," echoes a formless voice.

0h, 5189m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:23:55.99--
The light fades, dimming to an argent glow, and you turn to face your aggressor. Before you is Thoth, the God of Death, His true countenance concealed by a pallid mask. Still you can feel His eternal gaze upon you, devoid of all emotion as He affixes you with a cool stare.
0h, 5189m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:24:04.11--

0h, 5039m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:24:15.99--
The God of Death inclines His head, and your vision blurs. Dark shadows swirl and blinding light flickers before your eyes, the display churning with unrestrained motion until, with a sudden jolt, all is finally still. The aching thirst diminishes as your eyes adjust, and you find yourself kneeling before the imposing form of the Endbringer.
0h, 5039m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:24:24.09--
"You linger at the threshold of the Soulrealms. Whether cast here in dire purpose, or by unfortunate accident, it falls to Me to consider your fate." The God of Death pauses, inscrutable in His contemplation. Slowly, deliberately, He raises all six of His hands with palms facing outward.

0h, 4889m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:24:44.10--
Ghostly vapours flow from the fingertips of Thoth, the Endbringer, carving sinuous paths through the air to entwine around you. Your spirit lightens at the touch, every aspect of your being grasped by the formidable will of Death and darkness begins to overtake you once more. Just as you pass into unconsciousness, a single word rumbles through your mind: "Live."

When you regain consciousness, you are confused about where you are and how you got here. Darkness surrounds you, save for a single candle. A look around tells you that you are in a rough cave, with a single table bearing the candle. An entrance, visible because it is slightly lighter than the rest of the shadow, beckons from across the cave.
0h, 4739m, 24060e, 22559w  ex----s02:25:04.12--
Sitting up from your supine position, you glance at your body and realise it is healed and whole once again. Still reeling in wonder from your experience, you quietly ponder the Endbringer's reasons for restoring you to life, and leave the cave.

A feral humgii snarls angrily while pulling at its leash. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A scarlet scroll made of leathery skin sits rolled up here. A vast pyramid of skulls occupies most of the surrounding space in this area. A cast iron trough of bubbling tar is here emitting a noxious smell. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. A black mamba slithers here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A Champion's training dummy stands proudly, ready for redemption. Wings wrapped about herself, a ghost bat hangs from a nearby perch. Observing his surrounds with a piercing gaze, a ferocious red manticore paces back and forth. A ragged orc slave stands here with his shoulders hunched.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.
