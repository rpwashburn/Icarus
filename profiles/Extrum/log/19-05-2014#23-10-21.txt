Dear Xinna,

We are sorry to see you go, but realize that there was little more we could do for you.

Your weaknesses are clear as the day. Your lack of ambition, you have no interest in the world around you, you strive towards one goal but are incapable of stepping any further. The future is a fog to you.

You were lost amongst us, lost in the midst of Nature's glory. Changing from one class and lifestyle to another, no purpose and no goal in mind. There was little more we could do for you as one of us, we realize this.

Enslavement to Mhaldor will suit you well. We wish you an enjoyable lifetime in suffering, and expect to contribute to your learning.

advantageous knowledge that comes with this position, we require all
coders to give up their mortal characters.

   you will need to know before you apply.

I stand ready and vigilant, here to do what's right
When called upon, I will be ready for the fight
My citymates may rely on me, I will not let them down
We will wipe out the scourge, and in victory, walk back to town

I am ready to act for the good and righteous, doing for others as I see the need
I am young but I am learning, Filling my mind and pulling out the weeds
My knowledge will grow as I continue to train
I will fight with sword, fist and brain

I will help those who come after me
Doing what I can to prepare them for their adventure, their story
I will be there if anyone should call
To help them along the way, to demystify it all

So those who need me, younglings or old, fear not, I will be there to help the cause
Whatever it is, I am ready to take it on
When I grow old and gray, I will tell those younglings who I am
Arukhel of Targossas, I'm just doing what I can

like a book resting on a shelf,
I am at peace with myself.

Waiting on a  Divine.

Hear I sit on this bench of blueist marble
Listening to the rest of Cyrene's noises turn to garble
Waiting here with not much to do
For there is nothing greater than waiting for any of You.

Over my shoulder I look at Blu
An amazing sight to see this dragon true
Nothing compares to the sight I await to see
Nothing in Sapiance compares to any of Thee

Pandora with Her cupcakes and easy laughs
Phaestus with His hammer and heat blast
Scarlatti with His smile and musical sway
These are some of the Divine I await today

Other Divine I await to come through here
Ourania with Her beautiful lunar stare
Lord Sartan although it would scare me to death
Though I would visit Lord Thoth in my much needed rest

Many Divine I have yet to meet
To see them all at Cyrene's crossing would be a feat

the forest will take you and make you bound.

We will fight one another furiously,
Civil war and hatred,

Change does not exist,
mad passions out of control,
sleepy apathy making all null.

Split you in two, three, four,
joys within you will be no more.

Death to you while your Gods are self serving,
I watch you as you are slowly tortured from inside,
I ask,
Why?
Why?
Why am I here?
Why in Sapience do I hold you so dear?

For remember, my dear, your eternal plight.
For what you abandon in your doubt,
You seem to know nothing about.

I may not have many qualms with you,
But only in the lies you spew.
Change is eminent, don't you see?
No, you're blinded by your own stupidity.

As the cloak of Night falls across the land,
The Triad of old shall forever stand.
For the Moon shines down in Her fluid grace,
Silver beams of light eternally in place.

When the final candle blows out, in the gloom,
Will you find your Dreams to be your tomb.
As your fears and lies will be revealed,
Remember it is your fate that you have sealed.

For with every light, there are Shadows too,
Where Darkness lurks through and through.
Watch yourself for the Triad stands tall,

Subject: The mistake of Arcadia
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targossas,

It is unfortunate - but not unexpected - that Arcadia has met our attempts at communication with silence. With their silence they have damned themselves and with their continued support of the misguided Skylord they will no longer be afforded any protection by the forces of Good.

In supporting the Skylord fully they are also deemed enemies of Creation - in the same vein that those who are in His Order are. Let this be a reminder that supporting and sitting by in direct aid of an enemy of Creation cannot be ignored.

We fight for much more than our own pride, our own desires to be great. We must do what we must because everything is at stake. We do not have the freedom to ignore, to not act, to sit by idly. We strive to be great for Creation, for the betterment of the whole. Remember this as you strike down our enemies, remember this as you take each step, bathed in the power of ever burning Righteous Fire and illuminated by the ever-present blessing of Light.

In Their Service,

Judicator Davio Op'Shae, Guardian of the Blades

Subject: A sermon on conversion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As I sat down to write this sermon I had a lot of time to think about what being a Harbinger meant to me.    Upon joining Targossas we swear oaths to defend Creation at all costs and to serve in any way we are able.

There are many types of service that a person can give to defend creation and serve Good.    You can be someone who combats Evil, Darkness and Chaos with your weapons.

You could be one of those people that combats it through your words. You could also be the person that gathers the information that is used by other?s to combat Evil, Darkness and Chaos.

Those using their words to teach of Truth, Light, Righteousness and Good help to bring more into the fold of Targossas and the defense of Creation.

The more our words are heard--and the more people that have a chance to hear them--the more hearts we will reach. Each person that we convince to turn away from harming Creation is one more step to our ultimate goal of paradise being manifest.

Through Clemency, Succour and Deliverance, the Harbingers of Redemption have been given the task of getting the message out to those that do not know the truth of Good.

We have multiple ways of doing this.  One is with discussions and sermons.  We teach what Good is.  We show them why what they are doing to creation is wrong.
We give sermons to allow them to hear our words and hopefully open up their hearts to hear more.  Teaching them the truth of Good will open their hearts to learning more about Good, Light and Righteousness.

We do not stop there.  Our mission does not end when we convert them.

 We must then teach them well as help them to heal from what they have done to their lives.  We must also help them to begin looking for redemption for their actions.  This means giving them meaningful talks as well as allowing them to see us in our natural ways.

The behavior of a person can say much more than just what our mouths are uttering.   If we preach redemption but then we don?t give people a chance to be redeemed then we are working against the very thing that we say we are working towards.

Every person has the capacity for redemption, if they but ask for it. We also offer it when we are out in the world around other people.  You should not just be a combatant to your enemies but you should offer them the chance at redemption.
 
If you see someone doing something that is harming Creation you speak with them.  You explain to them why what they are doing is harming creation.  You give them a chance to atone for their actions before you look towards the next step.

From   : Lord Draekar Rian, Eminent Master
To     : The City of Targossas
Subject: Houses and You, a deadline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings Targossas,

On the 16th day of Mayan, 649 AF the Great Houses of Targossas opened their doors. This was a joyous occasion for us all, especially those who had been so eagerly waiting since the fall of the Jewel. Along with this opening the Bloodsworn Divine also gave a decree that joining one of these Houses was expected for all active citizens of Targossas.

As we head towards the fifth anniversary of these Houses the city council has discussed the matter of this decree and our need to begin the process of enforcing it.

It is such that from the 1st of Sarapin, 656 AF all active citizens must be either a member of one of the three Houses of Targossas or at the very least in the application process.

There will be some grace for those who are new to the city, or freshly returned from dormancy but this will be closely monitored.

So if you have not done so already please do look into the three Houses we have. The Dawnblade, The Harbingers, and The Luminai and make your choice as soon as possible.

Those who do not comply with this decree of our Divine will find themselves looking for a new Home, which is not something we wish to see.

If you have any questions at all please do seek out any of our Lumarchs or Ministers to ask and please those of you who are yet to choose do so before Sarapin, 656 AF.

Humbly, in service
Lord Draekar Rian
Eminent Master of the Luminai

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Small gouts of fire blossom from the nostrils of this small humgii, as he snorts in abject disgruntlement. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Scampering in circles, a squirrel monkey is here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. The statuesque form of a white marble gargoyle looms here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. The Silver Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.
