----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

From   : Vastar, the Skylord
To     : Everyone
Subject: Freedom
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have learned much, from both My travels, and the events of the Worldreaver.

Still, I hesitated to act on these lessons. Perhaps Sapience would learn from the terror of Bal'met, of seeing a city sunken and obliterated. Perhaps mortals would learn of their folly as the Pantheon shrunk, one by one, as Divine were slain.

I waited, patiently, for evidence that such events would come to pass. And yet, the lessons of the Worldreaver sunk as quickly as Shallam, buried beneath waves of stupidity.

Sapience has truly proven that the mistakes of the past shall continue to be repeated, an endless cycle of abuse and ignorance.

And so I withdraw your privilege of soaring in the boundless Sky amongst Mine. I withdraw your right to Freedom.

I withdraw that which I am known for. For too long has mortal ignorance stained My realm. For too long have I watched mortal hubris wield Freedom as a shield, as an excuse to cover for their lunacy. Too long have I watched Freedom be twisted, broken, stepped on by heels unworthy of claiming the cause.

And so I remove that hollow excuse from your undeserving lips, never to be used again.

The right to Freedom is one of utopia, of a world unstained by the tread of the ignorant. Freedom is now the goal on the horizon, rather than the excuse to fall back on. Freedom, from this day forth, shall be earned, not given.

My Farethi shall be the heralds to show the way, to educate the interested in having a place to belong in this utopia. The Bastion is the only city approaching this ideal. Through them, I will deliver the truest form of Freedom to the unwashed masses, to ensure they do not desecrate My vision.

Let Chaos reign.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freedom is not Yours to withdraw, Skylord, no matter how deeply steeped in its ideal You and Your followers may be. Freedom cannot be taken from us. Throw Your tantrums in the sky, cast Your disdain upon us, attempt to shackle us if You will, but You and no other can take away our Freedom.

Freedom is earned, yes. Freedom is seldom understood and frequently misused, yes. But Freedom is immutable and entrenched within the hearts of those who bleed for it. Freedom is not a privilege but a right, one that is occasionally abused but never alienated. You speak of a utopia, but open its gates only to those who meet Your approval. There is no Freedom in such a land. Exclusivity breeds narrow-minded conformity, Skylord, even if those minds embrace what You call 'Freedom'.

Wherever You have been, clearly it has twisted Your mind. Witnessing Your fellow Divine from afar, waiting for us mortals to learn a lesson and never once raising a hand to come to Their aid must have touched You in the head. You are no Skylord, You are just another minion of Chaos, tainted by its entropic caress, swollen with apathetic pride, hastening us towards destruction and condemning us for a crime You will not define. I cannot accept that You are truly Lord Vastar. If you are not the Skylord, Who are You?

Whoever You are, I defy You. You think You can remove Freedom from my lips? Then I will say it again and again.

Freedom.
Freedom.
Freedom.

Clarity keep, 'Skylord'.

I am not a well-known man, nor do I wish to be so. But There is something here I feel I must say. Recent events have frankly mortified me. I look at the world and see those who could help each other squabble and bicker, fight when the could work together to fly. I watch and see the works of men and women, good, evil, neutral, all wandering. Sir, you speak of freedom. You speak of a utopia of freedom. And then you strike down a soul who is brave enough to point out a flaw where they think they have found it. I do not see that as an act of Divinity, but as one of a child who doesn?t like to be told they?re wrong. Strike me down as you wish as you will undoubtedly do. I shall rise and I shall call to the heavens I will not be broken for that is my Freedom to choose. I have the Freedom to live or die. And now I exercise that Freedom to say that I watch your works and I find myself disgusted at those I have witnessed. I may not know much, but I know that one who uses violence where words could be more effective is not a leader I?d wish to follow.
Yours freely till the day I leap from this Mortal Coil

From   : Dawnlord Silas Maynard, the Voice of Light
To     : Everyone
Subject: Vastar, the Skylord
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings, Sapience,

In light of the Skylord's misguided proclamation, it is my duty to inform you all that worshippers of this so-called Freedom shall forthwith be denied entrance to the Dawnspear.

It is disappointing to see that even a God can succumb to such self-serving folly - especially One who stood against the Triumvirate in the War of Humanity, and who saw first-hand the horrors inflicted during the Chaos Wars - but we must all make our choices daily.

This is proof that it is not enough to commit yourself once against the forces of Chaos, of Evil, or of Darkness; this is a commitment that must be renewed each time the sun rises and a new day dawns, lest you too fall so easily into the clutches of that which you fought against.

I have mocked Ashtan's twisted interpretation of Freedom for years, but even I am surprised by this move. To see the Skylord Himself turn His back on the tenets of true Freedom, of Passion, of Individuality and Infinity for the yawning void of Oblivion is something I did not expect, even after the second great betrayal of the Jade Empress.

Alas.

Until such a time as He regains His senses and recants this stance, we will tolerate no shrines to the Skylord to stand in these lands. All shall be reduced to splinters and dust, and all shall be replaced with beacons to Light and Fire. So long as He continues on this path, any sign of His visible influence shall be eradicated.

Any worshipper of Vastar who dares to sully the streets of Targossas shall be asked to leave, and declared an enemy when they comply. Failure to comply will see you cut down where you stand.

To align yourself with Vastar's warped vision of the future is to declare yourself an enemy of Creation itself.

Make your choice, Sapience.


In Their name,

Silas Maynard de l'Evanoir

Subject: Unseeing moods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi all,
(TL;DR: CONFIG MOODS OFF is a thing now.)

Moods have gotten a bit of a mixed reaction, with some people really liking them and some people really disliking them. Fair enough! I'd generally prefer that you all like something or dislike it, as that makes decisions easy, but it's not the case here.

At any one time, currently about 25% of players are adopting a mood, which is somewhat higher than I would have expected actually, given that people turn moods on and off and that 25% is a snapshot of who is using it right now. That percentage rises to 30-35% if we only look at, for instance, just players level 80+ (newbies won't even know about moods at first).

While we decide what to do with moods overall to potentially make them better, we've just added a way for those who dislike moods to simply stop seeing them. CONFIG MOODS OFF.

We'll be pondering how to make moods better, but in the meantime, problem solved for those of you who dislike seeing moods.

Swaying to the Sun's rapture
stars linger in reflective abandonment
love ponders well-deserved sorrow
sunrise emanates the leaves' groves
weeping through excrutiating boughs
Adventure, a luscious cosmos
A wanderer awaits reflective delight
desert quivers in fermented abandonment
night ponders virtuous volcanoes
Eternity aches for virtuous cosmos
night soaks in steaming groves
leaves fiddle with velvet knowledge
moon lingers in reflective laughter
leaves in study

Subject: Petran Recycling
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A crash and a chorus of child-like cries disturbed the Petran peace one spring afternoon in 652, the crows taking wing from the fields before deeming it safe to return to hunting for worms once more. With a sigh, an old xoran in a battered flat cap oversaw the lifting of a crystal chandelier into his hand barrow. As the dust settled, he felt a little sorry for the three children it had crushed, but really, he had warned them and given them ropes and blankets to bring the heavy furnishing down safely. Ah well, at least the chandelier was still in one piece.

                              ~ ~ ~

A young vagrant had approached Drucker the previous month, a man he had heard some of the others call the Superintendent. He wanted help making his dream for Petra a reality. The village had been empty for years, no one yet to stake a claim. The tall man had ideas, and the energy of youth shone in his gaze, promising he could see them through.

Later that day, with a grumble and a hefty pull, Tinker Drucker jounced his barrow through the doorway of Sangre Keep. Determined not to look at the dust-covered corpses stacked like cordwood within the old fortress, his old eyes studied the rooms for anything that might bring some coin.

The chandelier hanging overhead would glitter beautifully, the tinker thought, once the shrouds of greying cobwebs were removed, but he would need a team to bring it down. With a brush of a sleeve, the rounded curves of a forgotten vase showed smooth and black, silver striking through the stone. These would do nicely, he surmised. The larger furnishings required assistance to move, including a statue of some imperious woman. Gods, it wasn't just the stone that made her figure seem cold and hard. A few items, small as they were, fought his touch, an effort beyond physical strength required to lift them and nestle them within the blanketed barrow. More than once the old xoran had to step outside to find some fresh air, settle his roiling stomach, and deny the terrors that seemed to creep closer towards his turned back as he continued with his task.

Most didn't speak of the demise of the keep's last family, but everyone knew about it just the same. The past seemed to have stirred again, disturbed from its slumber in history, and people were seeing and feeling strange things. At least they had Janice, he thought, offering what little relief she could to the vagrants. A life spent walking the roads had taught her much about sickness... and succour.

"What a haul! You've done well, Drucker." The Superintendent looked pleased with the lots picked out from the remains of the Karrellan estate. "I'll organise a couple of rooms for you down at the Brass Lantern, and you can auction these off to fund the rebuild."

Relief rippled through the tinker. It was not an unhappy couple of months spent outside of Petra's boundaries, and soon the night of the auction loomed.

Later that month, a tired but smiling Drucker returned to Petra, where he was met at the door of the Horseshoe Inn by a shabby crowd of vagrants and harlots, all clamouring to know how the preceedings went. Pushing through the doors, he leaned behind the bar and claimed a dusty bottle. Three long swallows drained the ale quickly, and Drucker stepped back outside to nail a length of parchment to the door.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targossas,
  Early in the month of Dadalean the seastrider known as the Lady Light set sail from the harbour Targossas. Captained by Garis, she carried with her Kaiu, Lachlan, Shros, Renoa, Iskla, Caladbolg, and me. As we headed to a destination only known by the captain the passengers chatted cheerfully in anticipation. As the anchor was dropped wild celebration broke out. Everyone wielded a pole and lines were seen being cast all over the ship.

It was a fishing contest of course. In efforts to continue the fundraising for the Dawnguard Kaiu and I invited everyone out to fish. The rules were simple whoever caught the most pounds of fish won.

What was the grand prize you ask? the best prize of all the fun and companionship of your fellow city mates as well as watching Caladbolg try to fish with a bastardsword.

The total amount raised was: 88,565 gold, which Shros bumped up to an even 100,000.

Separate donations to the Dawnguard also include

18,000 gold from Dagnarille
 7,000 gold from Rhyos

Bringing total donations for the Dawnguard up to 125,000 gold so far.

Subject: Standing Order with the Skylord
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings Targossas,

As all of you should be aware of, Lord Vastar has made His purpose clear for all of us. With this in mind, Lord Vastar is now considered an enemy of Creation. As such, all of His followers are enemies of Creation, as well.

Our new standing order on the matter is that His shrines will be reduced to dust - all of them. His influence will be eradicated. We have removed the visibility of Babel, Ourania, and for the most part Sartan shrines and this will be much of the same. We will start this process with the end in mind, so for the mean time if you take a shrine we will be raising a shrine to the Lord or Lady in it's place. Keep this in mind.

We will not be defiling shrines to any Other during this time - our focus will be solely on Lord Vastar's shrines. The only exception to this rule is if you're fighting Mhaldor on the isle or within Mhaldor, you may use their shrines against them. But do not do so without a clear fight.

Any who defile will be held responsible for helping raise. This will not be finished without much retaliation and, as is common for us in these conflicts, we will win in the same way - unrelenting focus, planning, and resolve.

In service,

Davio Op'Shae, Guardian of the Blades

Subject: Ashtan
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings, everyone.

Ashtan is a strong city. They have a large amount of citizens, a high amount of combatants with a network of earrings and a large number of veils. They fight for fun, to satisfy a corrupt bloodlust and to cure their ever-present boredum. Some of them are skilled, some of them are not. They fight primarily in hordes or against weaker opponents, forever chasing an illusion of victory and power.

Their greatest strength is also their greatest flaw. What attracts the large number of ignorant fools that join Ashtan's ranks? An illusion of freedom, of doing little, and of an easy road to "winning". They are not unlike Cyrene, in the sense that comfort is what draws them. They have no purpose in life, so they have no expectations, and their citizens are left to do whatever they want, while reaping the benefits of the "power" of being Ashtani.

However, this is a great and powerful weakness. Due to the fact that nothing at all unites them, they are weak, drooling fools. When they make a concentrated effort such as in the CTF or year 650 bandersnatch, they have a lot of strength. They do not make these efforts often, because their citizens are fat, lazy, and useless. They have little motivation to do anything other than flail listlessly in an attempt to amuse themselves.

And that is how we will win this conflict. They will make a few concentrated efforts for a few months. Then fewer people will help. Then even fewer. They will hope we defend our shrines in small numbers, so that they may use overwhelming force to kill the small amount of defenders and use their bodies to defile more. That was their primary strategy in the Ouranian shrine conflict. And it is what they will do this time.

Do not rush out to defend shrines alone. If a shrine is under assault, form a group and engage only if victory is likely. Ashtan's forces are mindless and have exceptionally little spirit and backbone. Their primary strategy in this will be to kill defenders and defile like that. So deny them their goals, and allow them to exhaust themselves in the attempt to outhunt us. They lost last time. They will lose once more.

Endure, Dawnspear. Endure and remain united under the glory of the Bloodsworn. Our unity gives us strength matched by no other city, no other force. We have a battle on our hands, and it is in a field we are undefeated in. Let us strike down the piles of rubble the deranged Skylord considers His shrines, and replace them with beacons to the glory of Light and Righteousness. Let Sapience witness the radiant glory of Good.

Skill       : Spirituality   Ability     : Smite
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Priests are terrible at hunting unless they specifically build their traits (nimble as opposed to quickwitted), race specialisation, and artifact purchases around hunting - after which they become moderately decent as opposed to amazing like many other classes. A good comparison would be intelligence monks - they can build for intelligence, but even bash monk bashing damage is amazing, so they don't suffer too much. This is especially noticable at lower levels when a lack of criticals makes base damage all the more important.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Increase the base damage of smite and slightly decrease scaling with strength. Ideally, this would be a sizable increase, but leave the scaling at least a little attractive to encourage artifact purchases.
Solution #2:
Allow Priests to use spiritlash as a hunting attack, roughly half the damage of smite and scaling off of constitution. Additionally, make spiritlash lower in healing, so that it is more accessible for newbies.
Solution #3:
Allow Priests to use devotion purity for bashing (with no devotion cost when used on denizens), at a higher base damage than smite currently is.

Flinging emperor at someone makes them follow you without using their balance, allowing you to then be instantly summoned with empress to another location - even to a defendable totem. This is exceptionally strong, and can even be used against the leader of a group to decimate the entire group. The biggest counter is to unfollow, but then it's a ping battle between announcing emperor and unfollowing.

Skill       : Chivalry       Ability     : Disembowel
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
As it stands, anyone can completely negate the torso damage modifier of a disembowel with a simple tumble. Once the prep work for a disembowel is in place, if someone tumbles on a leg break - or at all - before the in room Disembowel is complete, the tumble-forced disembowel will not take into account torso damage modifiers. This is a problem because, with a decent amount of health, you can guarantee not ever dying to a disembowel (broken torso or not) by simply tumbling. Any and all work put in to break the torso is 100% negated at this point, and the three knight classes (Infernal, Runewarden, Paladin) have zero counters for it. Out of those three classes, Runewarden must solely rely on Disembowel as a kill method, as there are zero alternatives, making killing anyone with sizable health or above quite an almost impossible feat.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Tumble / Impale disembowels take into account torso damage, and would work the same as an in-room disembowel.
Solution #2:
Add an additional limb's balance cost to tumble if impaled.
Solution #3:
Increase the base damage of a Disembowel, allowing a better "chance" to kill your target if they've got high health and tumble.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Scytherus (relapsing) is instantly recognized by server-side curing, despite having an intentionally unspecific affliction line against those using server curing.  This significantly decreases the usability of the venom, and doesn't appear to be intended in the implementation of server curing.  Combined with the fact that flay/scytherus illusions are no longer an option, bite venoms are almost entirely unusable against those using server curing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Require relapsing (and the other "blood afflictions that have the same vague affliction line) to be diagnosed or caught via symptoms (like Loki currently works).
Solution #2:
In addition to solution 1, remove sileris.
Solution #3:
In addition to solution 1, create hard-coded illusions (such as flay) that are recognized by server queueing as "real", until otherwise diagnosed.

Skill       : Domination     Ability     : Balance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Lately there's been a trend to make Achaea more friendly to high latency non-Americans with the server-side queue and curing. The last thing left we keep doing slow and are "punished" by our latency is class balance attacks/commands (domination entities, etc). I think/it looks like the framework is there to fix this and class balance is already used/tracked in custom prompts. It is very frustrating when the target heals a prerequisite affliction for a key entity (cadmus, hecate) in the window between me/non-American sending the entity command and the command going through. This window is near half second and is more than enough to give time to faster latencies/server-side curing to mess offensive momentum during it often.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add "class" as a balance variable in the existing queue commands and implement a new/extra queue list for class specific balance commands. Size of this class queue is enough to be one (so a single string of info, I guess), or two if you want to take into account the rare occasions of orb(Actar)+another entity or priest self heal deaf/blind that is balanceless(?) + another heal balance command. Queue commands would look like: QUEUE ADD <BAL|EQ|CLASS> <COMMAND> (and maybe also QUEUE REPLACE <BAL|EQ|CLASS> <INDEX> <COMMAND>). The ADD command would check if we have class balance (entity balance for Occultists, etc), if yes, it would fire the command right away, if off entity bal it would fire it server-side imediatelly on ent bal regain.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Between aeon, tower tarot, ignoring elevation, and bypassing walls, dopplegangers still remain a little too powerful in Line of Sight combat. With tower specifically, they are able to simultaneously prevent ranged targets from leaving a specified room, as well as create a line of rubble to slow down potential melee rushes. There is no counter to it, they can do it with very little risk to themselves, and one tower can block every exit in a specific room, for five consecutive rooms into an area, providing too much control and preventing any desire to deal with it.

Solution #1:
Add an ability, perhaps in survival, that allows someone to clear rubble with a significant balance cost associated with it.

Skill       : Miscellaneous  Ability     : Limb prep decay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently all limb prep dissapears after 5 minutes of not hitting that limb on an opponent. This is still too long and allows limb prep classes to play much too defensively or even run away and know that their offense hasn't been lost at all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Reduce the time of limb prep decay to 2 minutes.
Solution #2:
If the limb prepper runs and stays out of the room for longer than 45 (or whatever number) of seconds all limb prep dissapears.
Solution #3:
All limb prep slowly decays over time, on a 20 second tick, regardless of whether that limb has been hit or not.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision:
Approved for the future, pending any adjustments to knights. Not viable until then.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hocuspocus illusions where used efficiently to throw off salve balance for jesters. With this loss, replicating with actual salve attacks can lead to a heavy loss in fashions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Lower required fashions (not necessarily used fashions, unless needed) for all salve based skills for earlier use.
Solution #2:
Lower required fashions for cripple
Solution #3:
Lower required fashions for mangle or concussion

Problem:
Even with the advantage of juggled axes, curing has caught up to handling aeon and removed some of the kill potential of jester.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add more skills to the list of puppetry/vodun that are hidden out of room. In particular slow and strip.
Solution #2:
After reaching a certain threshold of fashions (40? Not sure of the number), all reasonable puppet skills become invisible if used out of room.
Solution #3:
Allow to specify which skills you would like to hide at use time, with a heavier fashion use (puppet slow masked or something)

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. There are 3 alabaster pegasi here. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Restlessly eyeing the surroundings is a golden desert drake. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. An ivory jaguar stands here vigilantly, golden eyes taking in the surroundings. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A testament to his training, Ewig stands here as still as a mountain.  Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a Delosian bastard sword in both hands.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. There are 3 alabaster pegasi here. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Restlessly eyeing the surroundings is a golden desert drake. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. An ivory jaguar stands here vigilantly, golden eyes taking in the surroundings. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A testament to his training, Ewig stands here as still as a mountain.  Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a Delosian bastard sword in both hands. Acarina is here.
