A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

Subject: Public Notice: Estate Auction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings, citizens of Sapience:

Great names come and go, their legacies passing beyond the veil of this life, and from this passing opportunities arise!

A select estate sale is to be held upon the 6th of Chronos, in the year 652 AF, at the Brass Lantern Inn. Among various household goods, three fine antiques in excellent condition from the vacated Karella estate in Petra will be auctioned:

   - the patriarch's sovereign ring
   - a lace choker from the lady's collection
   - a music box

Ensuring interest and expedience, an entry fee of 10,000 gold will be required from all participants, including those who wish only to observe. All profits will be used in the reconstruction of Petra.

Subject: 2014 Achaean Photo Contest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's time to have a photo contest!

Here's how it works: You print out one of a variety of posters and then you take a picture of it somewhere cool. The top photos, as judged by the admin, win prizes!

Posters are here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xygi29biu5z3kwg/_xQTjV_eUS
They're all intended to be printed on 8.5" x 11" paper.

There are two categories:
 * Overall best - The coolest place, whether related to Achaea or not, that you can put that poster and take a picture of it. Don't put it on the wall of some awesome building and take a snapshot close up of just it on the wall though - the picture has to amply demonstrate why it's such a cool location. This could be something in nature, indoors, outside in a city, whatever. It could be super dramatic, funny, beautiful, whatever. It just has to be eye-catching.

 * Most appropriate - All the posters minus one have a picture of a God on them. Take a God's poster, put it somewhere that is relevant to that God, and take a photo of it there. Make it cool!

----------------------------------
Email address to mail the photos to: matt@ironrealms.com
In the subject line, include which category you're entering the photo in, and who your character is.

Feel free to include a descriptive note about the photo if you feel it'll help the viewer 'get it' more easily.

Contest begins: Now
Contest ends  : April 30th, 11:59 pm GMT

Prizes in each category:

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Kei Greywards is here. Reonna is here. Soldier Aelios Azon stands here looking happy. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Reonna is here. Soldier Aelios Azon stands here looking happy.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

Blackstone military quarter.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

6032h, 4422m, 27625e, 20200w cekdb-
A living puppet of Mithridates, its chest heaves a bit and its arms and legs move. Every detail of it is perfectly rendered, though the look in its eyes betrays no intelligence. It is a tool, not a fully living creature.
It has 14 months of usefulness left.
The puppet looks to have been fashioned approximately 73 times.
It weighs about 2 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Extrum.

A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 8 corpses of an ethereal spirit wolf here. Blood spattering the rich blue fabric of his robe, the corpse of Lurac lies here. His skeletal limbs bent unnaturally, the corpse of Haslac sprawls here. There are 2 corpses of a sleek, vicious red fox here. A small tuft of grey fur bound with animal sinew is all that remains of an ethereal spirit wolf. His cheerful expression abruptly shattered by death, Theralan lies here. There are 7 corpses of a spearhead shark here. There is a small group of shark teeth here.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 6 corpses of an ethereal spirit wolf here. His skeletal limbs bent unnaturally, the corpse of Haslac sprawls here. There are 2 corpses of a sleek, vicious red fox here. A small tuft of grey fur bound with animal sinew is all that remains of an ethereal spirit wolf. His cheerful expression abruptly shattered by death, Theralan lies here. There are 7 corpses of a spearhead shark here. There is a small group of shark teeth here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.

The Seven Truths of Evil

Truth One
What is called evil is simply the drive for advancement, for greatness.
We seek, through discipline and pain, to spur the advancement of nothing
less than sentient life.

Truth Two
Cruelty - the application of pain - is the method by which one weeds out
the weak and feeble-minded from the population.

Truth Three
Weakness must be eliminated in all its forms: Physical, Mental, and
Spiritual.

Truth Four
The enemies of strength are those who trumpet the effeminate values of
forgiveness, tolerance, and laxity of discipline.

Truth Five
The body may be made stronger through combat.

Truth Six
The mind may be made stronger through the elimination of conscience. One
does this by inflicting pain on others.

Truth Seven

[File continued via MORE]
The spirit may be made stronger by enduring hardships, both self-imposed
and externally imposed.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A bloodroot leaf lies here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Melodie Le'Murzen, Arcthyos is here, vines undulating about her form. Earionduil is here. He wields a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his left hand and a black steel staff crowned with blades in his right.

Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. The soul of Saeva roams the land, bodiless.

Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A bloodroot leaf lies here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Lurking around, Snow, an albino dire wolf watches silently.  Nyderrasethi is here. Vice Admiral Avianca Shu'in-Crescent is riding on an alabaster pegasus.

On the clouds (indoors).
A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Shedding its glorious luminescence, a lightweaving of a corpse resembling Bonko is suspended here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A bloodroot leaf lies here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Vice Admiral Avianca Shu'in-Crescent is riding on an alabaster pegasus. She wields a Raphaelan mace in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Avianca in her right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and in.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. There is a small group of shark teeth here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.

A death adder lies here, guts leaking from its body. There are 6 corpses of an orc soldier here. There are 2 potash crystals in 2 groups here. There are 2 corpses of an orc guard here. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey.  Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

On the clouds (indoors).
A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Shedding its glorious luminescence, a lightweaving of a corpse resembling Bonko is suspended here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby.  Atalkez al'Dejan, the Damned is riding on a Baarian tiger. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and in.

Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. There are 4 throwing axes here. There are 5 potash crystals in 5 groups here. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby.  Earionduil is here. He wields a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his left hand and a black steel staff crowned with blades in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Atalkez al'Dejan, the Damned is here, a determined glint in his eyes. He wields a runic totem in both hands.

A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Shedding its glorious luminescence, a lightweaving of a corpse resembling Bonko is suspended here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. Alert to her surroundings is an iron-clad black bear. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby.  Blackthorn General Rangor Corten, Guardian of Nature is riding on an iron-clad black bear. He wields a woodland throwing axe in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the House arms of the Sentinels of Nature in his right. Atalkez al'Dejan, the Damned is riding on a Baarian tiger. He wields a dwarven battleaxe in each hand. Earionduil is here. He wields a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his left hand and a black steel staff crowned with blades in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself.

A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. There is a small group of shark teeth here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A death adder lies here, guts leaking from its body. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. There is a small group of shark teeth here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A death adder lies here, guts leaking from its body. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey.

Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. Alert to her surroundings is an iron-clad black bear. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. There is a small group of shark teeth here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A death adder lies here, guts leaking from its body. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground.

A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. There is a small group of shark teeth here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A death adder lies here, guts leaking from its body. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey.

19.5.2 Classleads


What is a classlead report:
---------------------------
An avenue to suggest a change or addition to a skill or ability in the game.


What is NOT a classlead report:
-------------------------------
It is not an avenue to submit a bug. If you want to file a bug, use the BUG
command.


Who can submit classlead reports:
---------------------------------
Any player who meets the following criteria:
- Has played more than 50 hours.
- Is relatively active in the realms.
- Has more than the equivalent of one transcendent skill spent in lessons.


How do I submit a classlead report:
-----------------------------------
When submissions are open you may CLASSLEAD NEW <skill> <ability> to create a
new report. This will inform you if it has been successful, and give you a
report# to use for further modification. If you are not submitting a problem
with an existing skill, please use "NEW" as the ability name.

From here, you will need to fill in the details of the report, using the
[Type MORE if you wish to continue reading. (31% shown)]
6655h, 4715m, 12494e, 21685w cexkdb-
[File continued via MORE]
report# you were given:
- CLASSLEAD <#> PROBLEM <text>
 - Use this to describe the problem with the ability. The more concise
   you can be, the higher the chances of the report being actioned.

- CLASSLEAD <#> SOLUTION <1-3> <text>
 - List up to 3 solutions to the problem, again, be as concise as
   possible. You do not need to flesh out every detail, we will contact
   you further in the event your report is actioned if we need more
   details.

- CLASSLEAD <#> SUBMIT
 - Submits your classlead report. Once this is done, it becomes locked
   for editing, and becomes accessible to any player to look over.

-- Note: You may only have five (5) classlead reports at any time, per
   cycle. If you do not SUBMIT your classleads, they will not be considered
   as a part of the current cycle.

More handy commands:
--------------------

- CLASSLEAD LIST [<SKILL>|UNSUBMITTED|SUBMITTED|APPROVED|REJECTED]
 - Show a refined list of classlead reports.

- CLASSLEAD LIST [CENSURED|ENDORSED]
 - List classleads you have either endorsed or censured.

- CLASSLEAD SHOW <#>
 - Show a classlead report in full.
[Type MORE if you wish to continue reading. (65% shown)]

[File continued via MORE]

- CLASSLEAD <#> SKILL <skill>
- CLASSLEAD <#> ABILITY <ability>
 - Reassign an existing report's skill and ability.

- CLASSLEAD <#> DELETE
 - Delete one of your own reports.

What happens next?:
-------------------
Classleads run in cycles: There will be a period of open submission, followed
by a review period where no new classleads can be submitted. During this time
of review, players can CLASSLEAD <#> ENDORSE <reason> or CLASSLEAD <#> CENSURE
<reason> any and all submitted reports - allowing players to add their support
to a suggestion, or to disagree with the proposal. The same restrictions apply
to endorsing and censuring as they do to submitting a report.

After this review period, the Garden and ACC will review the submitted reports
and implement those which are accepted.


Notes from Administration:
--------------------------
The classlead system is one that acts on maturity and level-headedness. Players
who choose to abuse the system, or other players based on their ideas and
submissions will face administrative punishment - up to, and including the
permanent loss of your character(s).

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand. Niks is here, giving off a truly ghastly stench. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right. Sir Antonius Agarwaen, Inquisitor of Heretics is here. He wields a golden-bladed Inquisitor's broadsword in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right.
