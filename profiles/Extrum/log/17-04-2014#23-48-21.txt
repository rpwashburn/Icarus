Subject: In which deception is approved
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Lord vastar,

It is good to see that in Your time away from the light of Achaea You had time to absorb the teaching of Lord Twilight. The strong foundation in lies and deception You are apparently giving Your followers will surely benefit them in their quest for Freedom, though perhaps it will raise questions on Your assurance that the Archons of Ashtan were elected with 'Freedom'.

I look forward to seeing upon which other Divine Your realm intrudes,

Yours in anticipation,
Accipiter

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That you believe penning such a missive would do anything other than prove the foresight My Primarch had in denying you outright is the definition of hubris.

When mortals begin to believe any of the decrepit waste that flows from your mouth, or from the ink directed by your fingers, that will signal the time in which I will give up any semblance of hope for the world.

Never again make Me the address of your foolishness, or you will learn how much displeasure I take in outright deception.

Darkness rises constantly,
trying to crush the light,
but as I bask
in nature's beauty,
I know
it will be all right.
I walk through the streets of Caerwitrin
watching the children run andplay.
Whatever I was feeling,
I have a smile on my face today.
I see the people thriving,
cheerful in spite of the snow.
They know that it's a hazard,
but they stand firm,
they won't go.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. A nebulous water weird is here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Kei Greywards is here. She wields a bard's flute in her left hand and a targe shield of rutilated glass in her right. Reonna is here. The Silver Dragon Draekar's imposing form looms. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Soldier Aelios Azon stands here looking happy. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. A nebulous water weird is here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Kei Greywards is here. She wields a bard's flute in her left hand and a targe shield of rutilated glass in her right. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. A nebulous water weird is here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Kei Greywards is here. She wields a bard's flute in her left hand and a targe shield of rutilated glass in her right. Oathsworn Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right. The Silver Dragon Draekar's imposing form looms. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Soldier Aelios Azon stands here looking happy. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. The Silver Dragon Draekar's imposing form looms. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is here. He wields a crystalline elemental shield in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right. Reonna is here.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Soldier Aelios Azon stands here looking happy.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right. The Silver Dragon Draekar's imposing form looms. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. The Silver Dragon Draekar's imposing form looms. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.

On the clouds (indoors).
Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. There are 2 swarms of bees here. A bright-eyed zebra finch hops along the ground, loosing bursts of merry, warbling song. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A pike with the decapitated head of Atalkez has been erected, bearing the city arms of Targossas. A pike with the decapitated head of Isaiah has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Kross has been erected. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  Sempai Fendrel Azon-Mercadia, Airborne Tiger is here.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. Some irid moss has been left here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. A bloodroot leaf lies here. The decapitated head of Dajio has been carelessly tossed aside. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Reonna is here. Oathsworn Shiro is here. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff.

Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A swarm of bees hovers menacingly nearby. A bright-eyed zebra finch hops along the ground, loosing bursts of merry, warbling song. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A pike with the decapitated head of Atalkez has been erected, bearing the city arms of Targossas. A pike with the decapitated head of Isaiah has been erected. A pike with the decapitated head of Kross has been erected. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes. Watered-down blood surrounds the lifeless form of a lake fairy. A pike with the decapitated head of Dajio has been erected. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  The Black Dragon Dannyl's imposing form looms.

Atop the battlements of the city wall.
Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Resting on the ground is a cube-shaped silver sigil. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Perched upon the edge of the battlement, a statue of Tanris Rozzan stares sightlessly across the land. Mounted atop the battlement, a mighty wooden ballista points out over the gates. There are 5 Ashtani corsairs here. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. There are 2 giant eagles here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Chasing his tail excitedly, a Jaruvian retriever puppy runs about in circles. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. There are 5 cedar chairs with a covering of bright blue fabric here. Kohai Aquilora Straidthan, Ashuran Initiate is here. Her face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. Sempai Fendrel Azon-Mercadia, Airborne Tiger is here.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Some irid moss has been left here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. A bloodroot leaf lies here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields Ad'zeekh, Whispering Bow of the Tsol in both hands. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A pileated gibbon reclines upon the ground, scrunched behind its long limbs. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Some irid moss has been left here. A piece of dried-out kelp has been left here. A bloodroot leaf lies here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

You close your eyes and hold a puppet of Fendrel up to your forehead.

Entry to the Merchant's Quarter.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted in the ground. Encased in gold-plated armour, a knight of the Illuminati stands motionless in silent vigil. There are 2 Shadow Amazons here. Casually sending electricity to dance between the fingers of her iron gauntlet, a smirking War Witch of Ashtan stands guard. A small cooking stove stands here. Ever-vigilant, the Zarathustran eagle monitors the area for threats. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. There are 2 stone gargoyles here. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Fading into the shadows, Sakuri eyes her surrounding suspiciously. Calmly standing nearby is a white charger in pristine armour. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead.  Venser is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand. Rip Cobra is here, shrouded. He wields an antique lash in his left hand and a deadly dirk in his right. Sempai Datrius Neige is here. Kohai Knyx Cholla'Yi, Ashuran Tiger is here. Her face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. Sempai Fendrel Azon-Mercadia, Airborne Tiger is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Brother Senel Vorondil-Windsong, Pilgrim of the Body is here. Oathsworn Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is here.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. There are 3 throwing axes here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.
