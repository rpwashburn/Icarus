All hail Lord Sartan! Our Lord has tasked us this year with piking the heads of twenty enemies at the gates of Mhaldor, and converting three heathens. As the Blood Congregation, demonstate to Mhaldor, and all of Sapience why we are to be feared, and why our Lord's orders are absolute. Focus your efforts on both those new to the world, and established adventurers. We will not fail in the task assigned to us.

Focus hard on aiding the young Malefics. They are our future and the Master requires competent new preachers of His will.

Subject: On the First Axiom of Righteousness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambassador,

As Siduri has rather eloquently stated, context is key with all things, and the Axioms are no different. The answer to all of your questions and concerns about the sanctity of our creed may be adequately covered by brief meditation upon the First, which is as follows:

"Above all else, Creation must be safeguarded."

The servants of Righteousness hold no vast libraries of wordy texts, which require a scholar's eye to dissect and discern. We exist as servants of the Shield of Creation, with only one task at mind and in our hearts. Our lives, and everything that we are lay before our task. Nothing else is more important.

We will do whatever is required to stem the tide of Chaos. Scores of worlds have already been lost to the encroaching Void, resting in twisted and corrupted torment beneath starless skies. No game of tit-for-tat moral superiority will save the worlds that are subject to the foul taint of Chaos - only affirmative, precise and prompt action.

As such, morality and mortal edicts are of no import to us. This does not mean that morality has no place amongst the servants of Good, but rather that those who serve Righteousness specifically are willing to cast it aside in the light of protecting Creation, should it interfere in any fashion. The Aarash Kheyr and the followers of the Lightbringer all serve a vital role in promoting Growth amongst Creation, and without them, we would be woefully unequipped to handle affairs that sit closer to the seat of one's soul.

And thus is Good, comprised of the Light and Righteousness together in unison, towards one goal.

I encourage you, and anyone else who wishes to learn more of the Axioms, to seek out any whom bear the title of Caefir - or myself - for further discourse on the matter. I have taken the liberty of placing a small post upon the stony sands of the Mhojave Desert at the foot of the Vashnar Mountains, bearing the Axioms in their entirety, for all of those who are curious of their purpose, but perhaps too timid to ask themselves.

From   : Masterful Metallurgist Hiroma Moliuvia, Iron Alchemist
To     : Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen
Subject: A few more questions...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had just a few more questions, O wise one...

"Above all else, Creation must be safeguarded." So, you claim to safeguard Creation against... something. Presumably Ashtani, Mhaldorians, and Hashani OH MY! But riddle me this, who of the mortals saved all of Creation from the big, scary monster that sank all your huts and libraries? Which brings me to another interesting note. Most of you Targossians came from Shallam, which prided itself in its libraries. Now you pride yourself in lacking libraries and big fancy words? Make up your mind.

"Scores of worlds have already been lost to the encroaching Void, resting in twisted and corrupted torment beneath starless skies." So... On multiple, if not every other occasion, the servants of Chaos, direct and indirect, have won out against the servants of your righteuos gods. Interestng. Is there a notation on how many times Chaos has failed? Oh... Right, sorry, forgot, you all decided not to read. Should I even keep writing...? I suppose I shall, for those few interested in the musings of an aging youngster of some small, if old, repute.

"I encourage you, and anyone else who wishes to learn more of the Axioms, to seek out any whom bear the title of Caefir - or myself - for further discourse on the matter." Pardon the bluntness on this one, but this is an outright, blatant, and obvious lie. If I find a Targossian, it will be one of two places. One, in Ashtan or Mhaldor, slaughtering innocent denizens of the city until someone wakes up with a modicum of military prowess to forcibly eject you from our dwellings. Or B, in Targossas, where I and half of Sapience would be forcefully violated about the face and neck with pointy objects of a presumably bladed nature until we expire or flee from your presence.

I am far from ignorant Daeir, and even further from stupidity. Please do not even attempt to consider lying to me such as that again, for nothing will come of it. You have yet another rule that says, "Whatever you feel like doing is okay, s'long as you're doing it to save Creation." Vague justifications are both laughable and ridiculous at the same time. I know, KNOW, for a fact that even association with associates of Ashtani is enough to be ejected from the city of Targossas. Are you better than those currently abandoned and rejected by their Gods while doing the same thing? I know several Ashtani who cannot even associate with their blood family, their kin, because of your ridiculous laws, and you expect anyone to believe you are capable of having a casual conversation with a Hashani? A Mhaldorian? An ASHTANI? My kinsmen, especially my father, Rean Moliuvia, or my political inspiration, Tanris Rozzan, would have slaughtered you all and made no excused. No lies. They would have told the God's honest truth about it; they did it because they enjoy killing worthless louts with no value to creation. Unfortunately, I lacked the inherent drive to slaughter your people in the hundreds that my father possessed. My mother's son, I suppose, but do NOT lie to me.

With your own post, your own words, you have made a mockery of yourself and all you stand for, to which I sit laughing. You preach you will do whatever it takes to protect Creation, and yet the same people you claim will protect us sat in their walls and libraries, resturaunts and cafes, and died to the Worldreaver. Died like a large group of lemmings near the edge of a cliff. Only when we all, ALL, banded together to combat the menace did we have anywhere near the strength to do anything about it, and even THEN we needed the sacrifice of poor, dear, sweet Maya to give us all a taste of Godhood, that we could assist in protecting Creation from the menace.

You are not the only ones protecting the multiverse, at least until its appointed time, when it will enter the Void and be swallowed in its entirety, or so you seem to believe. You NEED the strength of our warriors, the knowledge of our sages, and the courage of all peoples as a whole. Because what happens when the next threat arises? Will you cower and die that day, consumed by Chaos because no one else was there to help your dozen mortal warriors, and two Gods against the threat? Because everyone else figures you're more annoying than eternal damnation and a gruesome and violent death? Because people can concur that living and breathing anywhere on the same PLANET as you IS eternal damnation? That it is simply a slower, more gruesome, and violent repetition of deaths?

So, again, do not lie to me. But more importatantly, you shouldn't lie to yourself. You can't dispose of Ashtan, because doing so removes a large quantity of the skilled warriors on Sapience, leaving you as helpless as a lamb when the next major threat arises. And if you cannot dispose of Ashtan, or its Chaos worship, you are doomed to die at the hands of those you need in case of a major emergency. Thus, it seems to me that you have quite the conundrum. Die soon, because you eliminated those who might have helped you, or allow them to help you and embrace your loss and eternal damnation according to your gods.

So you go ahead and spout your petty lies to the rest of Sapience, but know that the vast majority of us DO have more intelligence than your average humgii, and can realize that when a murderer says, "C'mere, I promise I would kill you, sever your head from your body, and pike it at your own gates..." that it is a blatant lie.

Subject: What is the measure of an axiom?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The notion of context as that which grants meaning is an interesting one, especially considering the axiomatic belief of Easterners that Good is an eternal, enduring, and unchanging force independent of its servants, a force around which we ought to arrange our lives, to which we ought to subjugate our desires, and yet, which does not constitute any form of slavery. There is no more abject slavery than to the weaknesses of a frail ideology seeking to bring the death of history to a static world, devoid of greatness, in which aught else might be achieved. You would deliver unto us a world in which the aspects of life that make it worth living are banished to us, in which the children you raise are taught to abjure strength and to feel shame at its very mention.

So, too, do I find it alarming that the Caefir have essentially allowed themselves ideologically to ignore any and all laws, presumably including those of the Lightbringer's Order or those of the Dawnspear itself, if such a thing 'must be done.' Creation must be safeguarded, but not all of it; no, should you harbour ill intent in the silences of your soul as judged by those with eyes blinded by the fire and smoke of the Eastern pyres, you can surely expect a Caefir to administer your sentence forthwith.

So much for encouraging the diversity of life.

These Axioms of Righteousness might not require a scholar's eye, but were the Caefir really interested in the wellbeing of Creation, they would have faith that those able to rise to the challenge of their doctrine would do so. Instead, they seek to coddle this intellectual laxity among their followers, as though turning one's mind to ploughs and toil in the fields is a productive use of one's time in an era where the harbingers of Chaos routinely stalk the land with impunity. I say unto you that a better fate for your rusting ploughshares is to hammer them into swords, that they might serve the Lord and history and Strength. What is the rest of Sapience to do when Targossas lies idle in its self-appointed duties, when these fields to which you've claimed Targossans will attend instead lie every bit as barren as the vision of Creation you'd so eagerly foist upon the rest of the world, harrowed only by the shattered instruments of your citizenry's forlorn hope?

The followers of the Mad God teach that nothing will be spared the encroaching maw of the Void; were it the case that the Malevolent One stayed the scourge of Evil from the back of Sapience, that all motivation for improvement simply vanished, and that Targossas were the only hope against the howling Northern hordes, we would surely all bear witness to the tragedy of a City grappling against the creeping inertia of its own vision of Creation's ultimate future before succumbing soundlessly to the End of All Things. When you invariably fail in your task, would you consign these charges you deem innocent to the worst of fates once your bulwark lies broken before their eldritch might? Would you, in your last moments, then curse the short-sightedness that caused you to turn your face away from the mountain of the LORD and the one real chance your Creation had to prepare for this Day of Reckoning?

No, it is much more preferable to be that instrument, that scourge, in His hands, for even a slave in His city actively works toward the salvation of itself and the world from the tyranny of weakness. The Fourth Truth, after all, does not disparage the values of forgiveness, tolerance, and laxity of discipline idly; it disparages these effete values because they actively deny others the opportunity to overcome their own failings. These 'virtues' deny those persistent enough in the face of adversity the chance to discover perfection within themselves. Perhaps most damningly, they enable the sorts of flaws on which the followers of Madness depend for their numbers to grow and their plans to come to foul fruition.

In preparing for this Northern threat, you both would do well to heed the lessons of the Jewel; do not seek to bury them beneath the waves, alongside the ruins of its once-proud domes, as I once sought to do. Those things we consider to be the most enduring may crumble if they grow too divorced from the proving grounds of adversity. In withstanding this adversity, in weathering it, you might learn the real value of His Truths and, so doing, prepare for your Day of Reckoning... and in that day, atrocity shall overtake the world, and all shall walk in fear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Hiroma,

I am saddened to find that my good will was wasted in the face of your genetic animosity, but keep trying, you are only showing the rest of Sapience the narrowness of your spirit.

To answer briefly, your main concern:

Yes, we will need to band together and unite in the face of impending doom. We will need your best warriors, and your best scholars, as much as we will need every arm and heart to fight back the encroaching Void. When reason dawns on you all, when at last you realize the folly of your ways and repent of the actions that brought this world so close to Oblivion, we will welcome you and your kind amongst our ranks. We do not seek to destroy Mhaldor, Ashtan or Hashan, but so long as they side against Creation, we will need to fight them if only to buy time. We are not Shallam, our enmity is not that of a city, jealous of it power, but that of a glorious mission. I would rather have you come to your senses, and have you next to me, than slit your throat in a battle. Remember: No mortal soul is ever beyond redemption, no one is out of reach from the gripping hand of Truth and of the purifying caress of the Flame.

Also, there is nowhere in the Apostle's writings that indicate that we despise writing, or even reading. Simply that the main focus is elsewhere. We do not have to "make up our minds" in relation to Shallam, because while we may hail from the Fallen Jewel, we are no longer the same men and women who weakened it through pointless strife. I also find it ridiculous that you make light of the many men and women who fought bravely and died in the sinking city to buy your Bastion time, and that without the intervention of Han-Tolneth, your own city would lay in rubbles. After you show how much contempt you have for mortal life, I am surprised that people still take what you say about innocent lives at face value.

Forever Their witness,
Siduri Azagnanna

From   : Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen
To     : Everyone
Subject: On Strength and Pride
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Such hubris! If Creation could be saved by baseless pride alone, we would need to look only to the rank and file of the Bastion to find ourselves delivered from harm.

Alas, the reality is considerably different. The outer reaches of the multiverse lay devastated and broken, corrupted and twisted utterly beyond recognition by the Mad God's tampering. The magnitude of the foe we fight is all but invisible to those who blind themselves to the destructive influence of Chaos, much the same way that complacency and curiosity towards the Worldreaver in His early stages led to the subsequent deaths of a score of Divine, and the wounding of several others.

There is no deception. This is the simple truth. You may deny it, as so many others have, and continue to do. Live well in your ignorance, as your betters fight on to permit your hedonism and utmost disregard.

As for the musings of a freshly-mantled Droch, I need only to point towards Sartan's impeccable history in demonstrating the Strength He so espouses - particularly in the dramatic failure to see His former dreadlord and compatriot whisked away from the Worldreaver's clutches in failing maintain the vortex that led to their battleground. The Lady of Vengeance died a spectacular death at the hands of the Worldreaver, betrayed utterly by Her former master's weakness.

Upon the high seas when the night is dark, I often wonder of Her final thoughts, and the dawning knowledge of Her former master's true capacity. Perhaps that afforded Her some solace from the Worldreaver's final strike. Who is to say? The look of relief upon Her shade's visage when it was finally slain by the demigod masses may have been of sheer reprieve from having to suffer the history of knowing Her past with Her former Lord was all for nought but a prompt end upon the grey plains of Nishnatoba, surrounded by Dala'myrr.

Were such weakness but an ephemeral thing, one could almost pass such an event off as a temporary ailment, a remnant of His rejoining, perhaps. Alas, nary half a century later, Sartan effort's to turn a erstwhile Vashnarian priestess to Apostasy after she falls from grace proceeds in much the same fashion as His dealings with the late Lady of Vengeance, even as said mortal bears the full brunt of His malevolence.

What does this tormented priestess do? Writhe under His ministrations? Buckle beneath His relentless assault on her mind?

She turns to the wardens of Nature, takes on the form of the Viridian, and chokes His followers to death with her vines. The indomitable will of the Lord of Oppression cannot turn the mind of a single mortal! Thus are the followers of the Seven Truths - thralls to a divinity of illusory power, spurned on only by their own inadequacy, to torment the world at large with their wailing, and gnashing of teeth.

The only thing to be found amongst the ideology of the West is self-flagellation and delusion, whilst the North bears their pride as a cure to all ails. The Crown languishes in dusky irrelevance and the Heart of the Vashnars remains eternally silent, concerned only of its own affairs.

Look upon the world and know, Sapience. The beacons of the Lightbringer illuminate the darkest places of the realm, and the flames of the Righteous Fire blaze with purifying heat across the land. Two Divine stand against the will of three-fold Their number, and their servants thrive and prosper.

Decide yourselves, as to whom espouses the strength and tenacity required to defend Creation from those who would see it subjugated, corrupted, or destroyed. Let our actions speak of our faith, and our purpose.

Fools! Mortals of Sapience! Ramble, bicker, rabble, and rot! You have accepted the Truth yet declare another. You know the Truth- that all things return to the Void. To Everything. To Nothing.  Do not lie to your Children, Sapience! The Void is empty. The Void is full. There is no pain. There is no suffering. There is no sadness. There is? Nothing. Nothing is destroyed, and nothing remains. All is known as there is nothing to know.

You may march! You may stamp! You may shout! Nothing can stop the Tide. Creation is but a beach. You have built your fantastic sand castle on it. Yet the Tide beckons! It comes! And what of the sand and the salt and the minerals which have dissolved into the vastness? They are indiscernible. They feel no pain. They merely become one with the sea.

Redemption! At the End of a Sword! Yes, Bloodsworn, you and your gods can stomp, shout, and knock over every sand castle on the beach as the fat, petulant children that you are. And what of your's? It will wash away.  Brothers, heed me well. As Ayar to Proteus, as Creation to her brother Void, as a simple ores smelted, as the many children and brothers in mortality, shall return, but One!

As do all.

As do none.

Hail the Void which frees mortal binds!

Hail the coming Tide!

But let us not forget, what is most import: Hail the Truth!

Well, this is all exciting, is it not.

I tend not to let the idle writings of unreadable nonsense get to me, like that which the majority of highly excitable, yet uselessly retarded, of you like to write, but I feel I need to make a short point.

I am glad you all enjoy throwing the ways of life that others tend to follow around, as it is a somewhat enlightening experience for me. I am a big fan of education. However, I feel it would perhaps be a good exercise for the majority of you to become a little more relevant in worldy affairs before stroking yourselves in public. I do not even know who any of you are. Surely you have speakers from your respective cities with a little more credibility that won't sound like bigots that failed their novice learning tasks?

I am sure you all have something exciting to say, but I feel anyone that actually understands the beliefs they follow wouldn't need to validate themselves repeatedly on this medium.

I look forward to reading the posts of those who are truly "enlightened" in the hopes that someone will write something that I can read without all the hopeless word play and attention seeking antics of the mediocre and unrecognised.

If you have reached this far into my article: very good; you should join the Maldaathi, where we will train you well on an individual basis and teach you how to be really, really good at what you want on the path to becoming a truly strong Knight.

Subject: The Grandmaster of the Quisalis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Long had she waited for this day.

Long had she waited for a challenge, and yet impatience continued to build, threatened to overwhelm.

And finally, when the day had come, the adversary that showed itself did not rely on subterfuge, did not rely on skill, or intelligence. Instead, here was that belligerent Qui'sas, always speaking of the superiority of her race, of being the true representatives of the Quisalis, standing at the head of a gathered army to depose her.

When would these fools learn?

She listened to the tirade, allowed the words to wash over her. She paid them no attention, for they were the common ramblings of the over-confident, of the arrogant. Death would come. That was always the certainty.

Finally, when Penchal Fii'zile tired of words, she gave the order to attack. Tens of soldiers leapt to the offensive, and the Grandmaster of the Quisalis smiled for the first time in years.

When the dust settled, Penchal was left alone, the bare remnants of most of the corpses wafting away in a gentle breeze that flowed through the bottom of the Den. Penchal was under the foot of the Grandmaster. The battle was too short, not enough to sate her thirst; and so she made sure Sapience would learn of her new, more public role.

With a few choice shouts, accompanied by Penchal's desperate screams of pain, she announced her reveal, and waited. But rather than the hordes of adventurers, angered by their deaths at the hands of her assassins, she was met with only a single, scared Ivory Mark running around out of phase, and an explorer come only to delve into the depths of her Den.

And so she simmered within her cavern, and waited for when curiosity would overpower the cowardice.

A race of humanoid amphibians, the grook seem to be a fairly recent race, perhaps produced via experimentation with powerful magic. They have no memory of their origin in any case, and their only known settlement of note is upon the island of Ulangi.

Grooks are the most intelligent of the mortal races and exhibit many frog-like features. Standing around five feet tall with slender builds, their eyes are typically round or bulbous, found in all colours. Their skin ranges in hue from green to blue and from pale to dark, and their hands and feet may be webbed to varying degrees.

There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here.
