The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

Subject: Golden Giftbags
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All good things must come to an end, so we bid farewell to our Mayan Crown sale. Do not fret though, as we've just released an exciting new promotion! For the next couple of weeks, you'll receive a GOLDEN GIFTBAG for any purchase above 100cr! Ordering more than 100cr? You'll get one for every 100 credits purchased!

We've run giftbag promotions before, so what's different about this one? Rather than a giftbag with random contents ranging from mundane to extraordinary, golden giftbags come in 7 different levels. When you make your purchase, you receive a default (or level 0) giftbag. If you look inside, you'll see some herbs, sigils, inks, and gold. But don't take anything out yet! If you're feeling lucky, you can try to upgrade your giftbag to the next level... which could mean artefacts, credits, and more!

How does it work? Simple! GIFTBAG UPGRADE <bag> will attempt to upgrade your giftbag's contents to the next level of prizes. Be warned, however, that there is only a -chance- that your attempt will succeed. Higher level giftbags have a progressively lower chance of success.

If you are unsuccessful in upgrading your giftbag, its contents will be replaced with ONE item (or group of items) from the default tier. So if your bag is already at the default tier and you are unsuccessful in upgrading, rather than a group of 20 sileris, 10 key sigils, a group of 25 red inks, and 1000 gold... you might get a group of 20 bloodroot. So there is a risk of not getting much... but you will always get something!

Each bag can be upgraded multiple times, though remember, the chance of success goes down the higher a bag gets! If an upgrade is successful, congratulations! Your giftbag's contents will be replaced with an item from the next higher tier. Once removed from the giftbag, artefacts that can normally be traded in may be... traded in.

Once an item is removed from a giftbag, or if an upgrade attempt is unsuccessful, that bag can no longer be upgraded.

The tiers:
0 - Default level at which all giftbags start: you'll get some herbs, sigils, inks, and gold.
1 - Runic vials containing stat, experience, and critical hit boosting elixirs, or clay chips (worth 20cr to trade-in).
2 - Artefact pipe, Artefact vial, or ivory dice.
3 - Dragonskin quiver, drinking horn, Dagger of Reincarnation, or Serpentine Keyring.
4 - One of the level 1 artefact weapons.
5 - Wand of Reflections, Eagle's wings, Buckawn Amulet, or Wand of Portals.
6 - Veil of the Sphinx, Gem of Rapid Transmutation, Grimoire of Hasty Adaptation, or Girdle of Aegis.

To do this, you can:
GIFTBAG CHECK <bag>   - Check whether or not a giftbag can be upgraded, and what the next tier prizes are.
GIFTBAG UPGRADE <bag> - Throw the dice and try for an upgrade.

Just a quick note that we've added some supporting code to our in-game editor to automatically convert extended ascii characters (like international symbols, smart quotes, and the like) to regular characters! No longer will you see things like "Tecton?s" in your news posts(*) when people copy and paste from Microsoft Word!

TARGOSSAS NEWS #290                                     (05/01/2014 at 19:02)  
From   : Gibbi Jaydde-Stormcrow
To     : The City of Targossas
Subject: Library update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello Targossas,

	To ensure our wonderful city Library continues to grow and flourish, I have decided to make some changes.  One to increase our modest collection, one to potentially increase the coffers, and one to help raise interest in books themselves.

	Firstly, I would like to make a formal call for aides.  Over the years, I have had many people offer their services, and contribute works to the stacks.  An official aide would do much the same, but on a more consistent basis.  What I am looking for in aides is as follows:
-A yearly contribution to the Library's shelves.  There is no real restriction to the nature of the work.  It can be written by the aides themselves, or be something found in an ancient forgotten library.
-The willingness to check and replace sigils, as well as keep an eye on the Library's totems.
-The patience to keep the Library clean in the face of the occasional litter bug.
It should not be too hard of a job.

	Secondly, I will begin offering an editing service.  Many of us keep logs of events or sparring matches or even debates and sermons.  A lot of times, our quills move faster than our minds, and we end up with quite a bit of unnecessary information.  Myself, and maybe some brave Library Aides, can be called upon to "trim the fat" as it were, and present you with a clean, legible, and useful log.  This may include personal stylizing on request.
	Logs aside, I would also gladly assist in editing, proof reading, and transcribing all other sorts of writing and documents.
	I officially offer this service for free, but any tips so generously given will be used for upkeep and improvments to the Library itself.

	Lastly, I would like to start a book club!  Now this is not something that will be starting up right away.  There is still much to consider, such as when the club will meet, how often, how the book selection will be made, and where the snacks will come from.  Most importantly, if there is even any interest in one at all.

	So please, if there are any questions, comments, or concerns, please send me a letter or a message.  Though I tend to get back to messages much quicker!

Forever in Light,
Archivist Gibbi Jaydee-Stormcrow

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. There are 3 monolith sigils in 3 groups here. A partially-burnt letter has been left here carelessly. Keenly assessing its surroundings, an imposing boar whips its small tail back and forth here. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. Serenie, a little snow-white dove, lingers here with curiosity and joy. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Soldier Shiro is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is riding on an ebony pegasus. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself.
