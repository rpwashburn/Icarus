From   : Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen

Subject: On the First Axiom of Righteousness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ambassador,

As Siduri has rather eloquently stated, context is key with all things, and the Axioms are no different. The answer to all of your questions and concerns about the sanctity of our creed may be adequately covered by brief meditation upon the First, which is as follows:

"Above all else, Creation must be safeguarded."

The servants of Righteousness hold no vast libraries of wordy texts, which require a scholar's eye to dissect and discern. We exist as servants of the Shield of Creation, with only one task at mind and in our hearts. Our lives, and everything that we are lay before our task. Nothing else is more important.

We will do whatever is required to stem the tide of Chaos. Scores of worlds have already been lost to the encroaching Void, resting in twisted and corrupted torment beneath starless skies. No game of tit-for-tat moral superiority will save the worlds that are subject to the foul taint of Chaos - only affirmative, precise and prompt action.

As such, morality and mortal edicts are of no import to us. This does not mean that morality has no place amongst the servants of Good, but rather that those who serve Righteousness specifically are willing to cast it aside in the light of protecting Creation, should it interfere in any fashion. The Aarash Kheyr and the followers of the Lightbringer all serve a vital role in promoting Growth amongst Creation, and without them, we would be woefully unequipped to handle affairs that sit closer to the seat of one's soul.

And thus is Good, comprised of the Light and Righteousness together in unison, towards one goal.

I encourage you, and anyone else who wishes to learn more of the Axioms, to seek out any whom bear the title of Caefir - or myself - for further discourse on the matter. I have taken the liberty of placing a small post upon the stony sands of the Mhojave Desert at the foot of the Vashnar Mountains, bearing the Axioms in their entirety, for all of those who are curious of their purpose, but perhaps too timid to ask themselves.

From   : Masterful Metallurgist Hiroma Moliuvia, Iron Alchemist
To     : Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen
Subject: A few more questions...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I had just a few more questions, O wise one...

"Above all else, Creation must be safeguarded." So, you claim to safeguard Creation against... something. Presumably Ashtani, Mhaldorians, and Hashani OH MY! But riddle me this, who of the mortals saved all of Creation from the big, scary monster that sank all your huts and libraries? Which brings me to another interesting note. Most of you Targossians came from Shallam, which prided itself in its libraries. Now you pride yourself in lacking libraries and big fancy words? Make up your mind.

"Scores of worlds have already been lost to the encroaching Void, resting in twisted and corrupted torment beneath starless skies." So... On multiple, if not every other occasion, the servants of Chaos, direct and indirect, have won out against the servants of your righteuos gods. Interestng. Is there a notation on how many times Chaos has failed? Oh... Right, sorry, forgot, you all decided not to read. Should I even keep writing...? I suppose I shall, for those few interested in the musings of an aging youngster of some small, if old, repute.

"I encourage you, and anyone else who wishes to learn more of the Axioms, to seek out any whom bear the title of Caefir - or myself - for further discourse on the matter." Pardon the bluntness on this one, but this is an outright, blatant, and obvious lie. If I find a Targossian, it will be one of two places. One, in Ashtan or Mhaldor, slaughtering innocent denizens of the city until someone wakes up with a modicum of military prowess to forcibly eject you from our dwellings. Or B, in Targossas, where I and half of Sapience would be forcefully violated about the face and neck with pointy objects of a presumably bladed nature until we expire or flee from your presence.

I am far from ignorant Daeir, and even further from stupidity. Please do not even attempt to consider lying to me such as that again, for nothing will come of it. You have yet another rule that says, "Whatever you feel like doing is okay, s'long as you're doing it to save Creation." Vague justifications are both laughable and ridiculous at the same time. I know, KNOW, for a fact that even association with associates of Ashtani is enough to be ejected from the city of Targossas. Are you better than those currently abandoned and rejected by their Gods while doing the same thing? I know several Ashtani who cannot even associate with their blood family, their kin, because of your ridiculous laws, and you expect anyone to believe you are capable of having a casual conversation with a Hashani? A Mhaldorian? An ASHTANI? My kinsmen, especially my father, Rean Moliuvia, or my political inspiration, Tanris Rozzan, would have slaughtered you all and made no excused. No lies. They would have told the God's honest truth about it; they did it because they enjoy killing worthless louts with no value to creation. Unfortunately, I lacked the inherent drive to slaughter your people in the hundreds that my father possessed. My mother's son, I suppose, but do NOT lie to me.
With your own post, your own words, you have made a mockery of yourself and all you stand for, to which I sit laughing. You preach you will do whatever it takes to protect Creation, and yet the same people you claim will protect us sat in their walls and libraries, resturaunts and cafes, and died to the Worldreaver. Died like a large group of lemmings near the edge of a cliff. Only when we all, ALL, banded together to combat the menace did we have anywhere near the strength to do anything about it, and even THEN we needed the sacrifice of poor, dear, sweet Maya to give us all a taste of Godhood, that we could assist in protecting Creation from the menace.

You are not the only ones protecting the multiverse, at least until its appointed time, when it will enter the Void and be swallowed in its entirety, or so you seem to believe. You NEED the strength of our warriors, the knowledge of our sages, and the courage of all peoples as a whole. Because what happens when the next threat arises? Will you cower and die that day, consumed by Chaos because no one else was there to help your dozen mortal warriors, and two Gods against the threat? Because everyone else figures you're more annoying than eternal damnation and a gruesome and violent death? Because people can concur that living and breathing anywhere on the same PLANET as you IS eternal damnation? That it is simply a slower, more gruesome, and violent repetition of deaths?

So, again, do not lie to me. But more importatantly, you shouldn't lie to yourself. You can't dispose of Ashtan, because doing so removes a large quantity of the skilled warriors on Sapience, leaving you as helpless as a lamb when the next major threat arises. And if you cannot dispose of Ashtan, or its Chaos worship, you are doomed to die at the hands of those you need in case of a major emergency. Thus, it seems to me that you have quite the conundrum. Die soon, because you eliminated those who might have helped you, or allow them to help you and embrace your loss and eternal damnation according to your gods.

So you go ahead and spout your petty lies to the rest of Sapience, but know that the vast majority of us DO have more intelligence than your average humgii, and can realize that when a murderer says, "C'mere, I promise I would kill you, sever your head from your body, and pike it at your own gates..." that it is a blatant lie.



Yours in all due sincerity,
And forever in service to the Bastion,
Masterful Metallurgist, Hiroma Moliuvia, Iron Alchemist
