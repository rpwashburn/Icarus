The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

Subject: Treasury report, 652-53
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear City,

Enclosed please find the biennial report of the Ministry of the Treasury, 652-53 A.F.

This term, our finances settled down a bit, as the new credit sale prices and quotas are fully in place and we have managed to accumulate a stock of commodities to fulfill the new city improvement maintenance requirements.

The adjustment was not without its setbacks.  Due to a pricing error, a hitherto unknown 18 year old was able to loot approximately 1.3 million gold from the Trade Ministry by buying coal, then re-selling back to the commodity shop at a higher price.  As the said 18 year old (now 19) has had no further activity in the realms, it is likely he was working as someone's accomplice.  This was, of course, reported to the relevant authorities, and countermeasures have been taken to avoid a repeat of such incidents.  Be that as it may, the gold was not recovered, and the Trade Ministry required a further advance of 1 million gold to continue accumulating the required commodities.

On the positive side, we did have a healthy credit surplus this term.  The main factors behind the surplus were the reduced quota and the availability of Mayan Crowns for most of the term.  Of course, we will continue to keep an eye on the credit flows to ensure they are sustainable over the long term.

Finally, the Dawnlord's discretionary expenses were for furniture.  Miscellaneous revenues were from city hunting trips.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.

Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 4 alabaster pegasi here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. A fuzzy brown bunny quietly nibbles a blade of grass. Serenie, a little snow-white dove, lingers here with curiosity and joy.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Kei Greywards is here. She wields a bard's flute in her right hand. Tsarani is here. She wields an ornate steel rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Tsarani is here. She wields an ornate steel rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right. Kei Greywards is here.

The Plaza of the Faithful.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A weary soldier watches the world with tired eyes. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Luminous shadows coalesce in fiery splendour around the golden Pyre of the Faithful. An heraldic pennon flies here, bearing the city arms of Targossas. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 4 alabaster pegasi here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. A fuzzy brown bunny quietly nibbles a blade of grass. Serenie, a little snow-white dove, lingers here with curiosity and joy. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the west. A fiery efreeti spins madly here.  The Silver Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Aelios Azon, Blade of the Watch is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier marred with char marks in his right. Soldier Iskla Rian is here. Draqoom Van Helsing, Iron Fist is here. The Silver Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Heawon Rousseau stands here looking happy. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. Kei Greywards is here. She wields an ornate steel rapier in her left hand and a targe shield of rutilated glass in her right. Tsarani is here.

There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Soldier Ernam is here, calm and relaxed.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 4 alabaster pegasi here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. Serenie, a little snow-white dove, lingers here with curiosity and joy. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The reflection from a spinning aventurine crystal egg catches your eye as it floats here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. Tsarani is here. She wields an ornate steel rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right. Heawon Rousseau stands here looking happy. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Banek, of Targossas is here. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is riding on an alabaster pegasus. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. The soul of Kariss roams the land, bodiless.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 4 alabaster pegasi here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes.  The Silver Dragon Lachlan's imposing form looms. Draqoom Van Helsing, Iron Fist is here. Soldier Iskla Rian is here. The Silver Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Anedhel Azon, the Argent Hand is riding on a powerful black destrier. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 4 alabaster pegasi here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Varamoure, of Targossas is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. The Silver Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, calm and relaxed. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is riding on an alabaster pegasus. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. She is surrounded by one reflection of herself. Anedhel Azon, the Argent Hand is riding on a powerful black destrier. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Aelios Azon, Blade of the Watch is here. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Niks is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right. Heawon Rousseau stands here looking happy. The Silver Dragon Lachlan's imposing form looms.

Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 3 alabaster pegasi here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. In threat of being stepped upon, a diminutive tortoise cautiously rests here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  The Silver Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. An obsidian eye sigil is here. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
