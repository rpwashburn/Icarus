Subject: Smile
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Naive, infected little mongrel
Your half-witted Pollyanna outlook is shameful
You wear a smile like a scar
I'd rather you cut the lips from your face
Wear an eternal, bloody grin

I hope you see that death is powerful
I hope you understand that you are nothing
I hope that suffering finds your doorstep
Walk into the flames and let them singe your flesh
Break the sinew and bone that give you motion

May an arrow find its way into your heart and out your back
Smolder beneath a pile of burning coal
You will see that the world is a thorn
This life will crush you into dust
The dirt will claim you as its own

I wish to see your blood run like a river
I wish to see you destitute and broken
I wish for you to experience colossal, unremitting pain
Open your eyes to reality, then gouge them out

Where is your smile now?

Subject: Treasury report, 650-51
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear City,

Enclosed please find the biennial report of the Ministry of the Treasury, 650-51 A.F.

This term, the city built three new barracks, the setting-up costs of which were paid by our three Houses.  Each House donated 3 million gold (for a total of 9 million gold) toward this effort.

Shortly after we built the new barracks, the maintenance requirements of city improvements were substantially changed.  Previously, we needed only provide a certain amount of gold.  Now, they require commodities in addition to gold, though the gold cost has been reduced by about 40 percent.  In light of this, a one-time allocation of 2 million gold was given to the Trade Ministry to adjust to the new demands on its resources.

Recurrent funding for the Trade Ministry will be arranged when the costs of providing the necessary commodities are more reliably known.  As a rough figure, however, it would cost about 480k every two years to buy commodities at their minimum prices.  At the same time, the gold required to maintain our improvements (3 barracks and a scimitar) over this time frame has been reduced from 2.8 million gold to 1.68 million gold (a reduction of 1.12 million gold).  As such, unless we end up buying commodities at more than double the minimum price, we should benefit from this change.  But having said that, maintaining four improvements is still quite expensive and we will have to think carefully about how to manage this expense going forward.

It should also be noted that the quota of city credits that citizens may buy has been reduced.  During 650 A.F., the quota was raised to 15 to celebrate the semicentennial and the arrival of Houses.  However, it was reduced to 5 in 651 A.F. and will remain at this reduced level for the forseeable future.

Finally, the Dawnlord's discretionary expenses were 650k for a master shopkeeper's license, 129k for Dawnguard supplies, and 32k for furniture.  Miscellaneous revenues were from city hunting trips.

Subject: Conclusion of the Sartan Shrine Contest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salutations Dawnspear,

It is has been an exciting couple years here with the Sartan shrine defiling competition, but with it's conclusion I am proud to announce our champions.

Coming in first was Mithridates, with 160.5 points, and for his hard work and victory in this competition, he has been awarded 20 credits.

In second place we have Epiphany, who made it to a strong 140 points in the contest, and she has been awarded 15 credits for her dedication.

Great work and well done to all who participated! I hope to see you all carry on this momentum in the coming years without the need for reward.

In service to the Bloodsworn and Their city,
Zuko Shu'in-Crescent, Monk of the Watch

Penned by my hand on the 1st of Mayan, in the year 652 AF.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, a determined glint in his eyes. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a butchering cleaver in his right. Student of Quaero Senri, of Eleusis is here.
