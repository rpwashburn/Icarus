Your moss tattoo tingles slightly.
Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. A simple pewter flagon lies here, abandoned. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Oathsworn Deglin is here, looking drawn and tired. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a steel shortsword in his left hand and a steel Theran broadsword in his right. Devout Shelbie is here. She wields an ornate steel rapier in her left hand. Brivius is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

19.4.4 Elite Memberships

What is Iron Elite
------------------
Elite Memberships are an optional subscription you may buy to receive a monthly
benefit across your characters. It provides a variety of advantages to help you
develop your characters at an advanced rate, as well as allowing you to receive
additional benefits from other promotions we may be running.


Advantages of Iron Elite
------------------------
- DAILY LESSONS
Every character registered to your email address, will earn 5 lessons,
everyday, upon login. You will earn these lessons the instant you login. This
will net you 150 lessons per month which is about 25 credits. If you have 10
characters, that is the equivalent of 250 credits per month in lessons.

- BOUND CREDITS
Your account will earn 100 bound credits every month. These credits can be
distributed across any of your registered characters! In addition, you will
accumulate 5 more credits every month you are on the membership (up to 150
total credits per month).

- PERMANENT CREDIT BONUS
You will have a permanent 10% bonus to all credit purchases while on the
membership. In other words, members will have a permanent sale running. This
bonus will stack with any other sale we run.

- EXPERIENCE BONUS
[Type MORE if you wish to continue reading. (28% shown)]
6032h, 4439m, 27625e, 20200w exdb-
[File continued via MORE]
Your characters will receive an experience bonus ranging from 5% - 25% (see
below), to help you advance in levels at an accelerated rate.


Cumulative benefits
-------------------
Being a long-term Iron Elite member increases the monthly benefits, based on
the length of your membership! Each consecutive month you renew, you gain an
additional 5% added to your experience bonus, as well as 5 more credits to be
used however you see fit.

In your first month, you'll receive 100 credits, and a 5% experience bonus. In
your second, 105 credits, and a 10% experience bonus, all the way up to your
eleventh consecutive month, where you'll receive 150 credits, and a 25%
experience bonus every month thereafter!


Accessing the Credits
---------------------
Your membership credits are stored in a "pool" which can be accessed by any of
your characters. To access the credits, simply log in the character you wish to
access the credits on, and use CREDITS MEMBERSHIP TRANSFER <AMOUNT>, which will
convert them to bound credits on that character.

You can check CREDIT REPORT at any time to see how many credits you have
available!


Purchasing an Iron Elite Membership

[File continued via MORE]
Signing up is simple! Just head to http://www.achaea.com/credits
and follow the instructions listed there.

PLEASE NOTE: This is a recurring payment! As you sign up, you're agreeing to an
automatic, scheduled payment via your preferred payment method (PayPal or
Credit Card.)

If you're purchasing your membership via credit card, please keep your receipt,
as it contains order information that you'll need in order to cancel your
subscription.


Cancelling your membership
--------------------------
You can cancel your membership at any time! There are no obligations to keep
this going any longer than your wish for it to continue.

If you paid for your Iron Elite Membership via PayPal: Simply log on to your
PayPal account, navigate to the "Preapproved Payments" page, and cancel your
scheduled payment.

If you paid with Credit Card: Simply navigate to
http://www.achaea.com/credits?page=cancel and enter your order number (from
your payment receipt) and your email.

Iron Elite and HELP SECONDS abuse
---------------------------------
Remember that we track characters if they are logged in at the same time from
the same registration. So if you plan on switching all your friends to the same
email addy, you will effectively be limiting them to never being able to play
at the same time. Additionally, you will never be able to move them off the
same registrations, which will give them the ability to change the registration
info and effectively steal all your characters. Not to mention we will
permanently block the accounts and characters of people found to be cheating.

In short, do not try to abuse this, we will find out pretty quickly.

Some more minor tweaks just loaded up:

* Order members in the Ivory/Quisalis Mark are now highest priority for order writs.
* The activity indicator of a Mark member is now based on activity, rather than dormancy.
* The restriction on contracts between the same mark has been lifted.

Additionally:

* A slew of server-side curing updates for symptoms have been put in.
* Changing elevation in a room will now strip shield, much like moving rooms.

Nomads of the Sands

How long is long when living in a world of Sand?
Is it when you finished counting all of the grains in your hand?
Or perhaps at the end of watching the sand dancing through the land?
Does it even matter in a place where time is not in demand?

Roaming past memories, forgotten dreams, wondering why...
Do you find any answers in the desert's blazing sky
where there is only the wind and silence to reply
to the truths of the world you'd rather wish to deny?

The blistering heat makes lives learn...
Actions should not have a need for return.
While loneliness may make the heart yearn,
rekindle your lost fires, make them burn.

Harsh is the land, filled with golden grains of Sand
But no words are needed for sadness, loss or rant.
No need for betrayal, lies or secret cant,
only a heart pounding to truly understand

the existence of simple truth, trust and loyalty;

Subject: The filth in Mhaldor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targossas,

In recent months the heretics of Mhaldor have been attempting to lash out and are moving in force. They are raising more shrines, they have destroyed rooms in overwhelming force and have shown their cowardice month in and month out. They go after easy targets, they make sure that they can win before engaging, and they run at the sight of any real fight. They will no longer be ignored.

We have made shrines to the misguided Skylord all but irrelevant. As such, by the decree of the Bloodsworn our standing order, our focus - is switching back to Mhaldor, in full.

No exceptions are being made in this. Not a single raid, engagement, or encounter is to take place outside of Mhaldor, Mhaldor isle, or in taking shrines to Sartan. Unless it is in defence of Their beacons, or Their City.

Mhaldor will burn by the fire of Their Army, its walls will tremble beneath the might of Their forces. We will destroy rooms, remove shrines, and make them cower in the walls of their City. Not a single tank will go unused, every month we will burn room after room and kill them at every chance possible, no leniency will be given.

In Their service,

Judicator Davio Op'Shae, Guardian of the Blades

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings,

I need to remind all citizens that by decree of the Bloodsworn Gods all citizens of Targossas are to be members of a Targossian house.  All houses have opened up their membership process for you to join a house.  No one is exempt from this rule.  Everyone should be immediately looking to join either the Harbingers of Redemption, the Dawnblade or the Luminai.  If you are over the age of twenty-five contact one of the people in the house of your choice that is listed as able to induct.

In Service,

Carmell

Subject: Applications for Chancellor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citizens,

Daeir Wintermourne has worked assiduously and tirelessly since the very birth of Targossas, and has earned his rest. As he has requested leave from his position, I am calling for new applicants to the post of the Chancellery.

The Chancellor handles the business of business in the Dawnspear. The security of the shops and the mercantile policies which govern them all fall beneath his oversight. They are the harridan of merchants, the sovereign of the shops, the catalyst of commerce. Additionally, the city-run shops must be stocked and attended to maintain them as healthy sources of revenue, and coin must be counted.

The position is open to everyone in the Dawnspear, young or old. Experience is helpful, but only heart, organisation and diligence are required. Familiarity with shopkeeping (as well as a shopkeeper's license) is encouraged, but unrequired. If you wish to make an impact on the community which you live in, this may be the position for you.

Anyone wishing to take a stab at it should write a letter to me, declaring their intent and any qualifications which they have. The application period will last six (6) months from the date of this post, after which time a decision will be made. Good luck.

In Their service,

Halos Vorondil
Lumarch of the Conclave
