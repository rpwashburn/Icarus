Wow! There is a lot of noise on the public new boards. To be honest, though... All I am hearing is:

        Ashtan says in a manic, overpowering voice, "ASHTAN!"

        Cyrene sings softly in a captivating trilling voice, "Cy......RENE!"

        Targossas says, "MHAL--" ...no, crud. I got that wrong.

        Ashtans sing in a manic, overpowering voice, "Ash-TANTANTAN Ash-TANNYTANNYTAN."

I think this newboard needs more giraffes. So, without more waiting, I present you my favorite giraffe - Mr.Bitey.

Mr.Bitey is a dwarf giraffe, and he is one strange guy. He looks all... shiny... and pink. He has no eyes, and he weighs next to nothing. As a matter of fact, I am sure I have seen my fellow jesters riding him up into trees before. I find this messed up, because, well... he tends to pop. Like a balloon or something. Have you ever taken a balloon up into trees before? It is -really- hard to keep them from popping.

What I would really like to see... is more friends for Mr.Bitey. He's really lonely, I think that is why he pops all the time. Therefore I would like to invite any and all people that can bring a friend, perhaps a lady giraffe, for Mr.Bitey to leave the friend in Delos somewhere. Anywhere really. Fill the whole place with friends for Mr.Bitey.

Farewell, Sapience.
May luck be on your side no matter who you are.

Subject: Moods!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's been a big 7 days in Achaea, what with the extremely popular new lesson packages, server-side curing, multi-command server-side aliases, and the start of the City meetings (beginning with Cyrene) to coordinate House restructuring.

And now there's another new system for your RP enjoyment: Moods.

HELP MOODS will tell you all about it, but the tl;dr is that by setting your character to one of our pre-defined moods, a bunch of outward-facing text about your character (says, tells, shouts, movement, room look, etc) will change to reflect that mood.

We've launched the system with 16 public moods, and plan to add more moods that can be collected in various ways such as questing, leveling up, Shop of Wonders, and so on.

Enjoy!

Subject: Mid-April Madness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned earlier in the month, there would be a change of promotion half-way through April! Due to overwhelming demand, we're putting on a pure Mayan Crown Sale!

How it works:
-------------
This is a tiered bonus sale with 6 tiers. The tiers are: 100, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 credits. Whenever you hit one of these tiers during the promotion, you will receive a certain number of Mayan crowns: 1, 2, 2, 5, 10, and 10 respectively. If you should hit the top tier, you'll loop back around to the lowest tier again! You can check your status at any time with the SHOWREWARDS command.

Mayan crowns can be used to purchase special artefacts found at the Shop of Wonders in Delos. The Shop of Wonders is located 2xNE then 5xN from "On the Delosian Bridge".

A crown sale would not be complete without some new wares for the Shop of Wonders, so I proudly present:

Mood Caches
-----------
Fire      - 4mc
Ice       - 4mc
Wind      - 4mc
Rage      - 1mc
Swagger   - 1mc
Predatory - 1mc
Amorous   - 1mc

OPENing one of these tiny caches will unlock that mood for your character! Check out HELP MOODS for more information on the MOOD system.

Subject: Fund raising
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings Dawnspear,

  I have worked alongside all of you for a few years now and I have fought side by side with pride as we battled the focus of Chaos and Evil. I gladly dedicate my blades every day to the Bloodsworn and revel in my enlistment in the Dawnguard. It is with joy that I give all that I am to be a shield for Creation, to hold the line and fight the misguided miscreants who threaten all of Creation.

  I know that I am not alone in my beliefs, in fact I am sure almost all of you agree with me and stand beside me. But I come to you all today to address a need that cannot be ignored. Gold, the fuel that feeds all great armies. While we all serve without question there is still need to fund many programs to extend our need.

  It is this reason I come to you all. Right now I am looking into ways to raise funds to fuel the Dawnguard I would ask of each of you to let me know how you can contribute. I will be running some fundraisers and am in need of prizes and other rewards. So if you are able to provide things such as Herbs, Minerals, Venoms, various refills, enchantments, forgings, or anything else then I ask that you let me know what you are willing to give. Gold is our goal so if you just want to give large sums of gold or credits you can do that too! Just contact me and we can work it out.

I look forward to hearing from many of you,
Sir Morthif Aristata
Knight of the Watch

The Champions' Bridge.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. There are 2 Blackstone swordsmen here. A noble snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Flapping its massive wings, a dire bat flies overhead.

Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A scorching wall of fire stands here, blocking passage to the south.

A frozen chamber beneath the barracks (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. An obsidian eye sigil is here. There are 5 metal tanks radiating waves of heat here. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Enran tends to his duties with studied concentration. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a crystalline elemental shield in his left hand and a roughly-hewn crystalline staff in his right. Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands.

A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Balancing on her long legs is a giraffe calf. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 2 guardian angels here.  Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, a determined glint in his eyes. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.

19.5.2 Classleads


What is a classlead report:
---------------------------
An avenue to suggest a change or addition to a skill or ability in the game.


What is NOT a classlead report:
-------------------------------
It is not an avenue to submit a bug. If you want to file a bug, use the BUG
command.


Who can submit classlead reports:
---------------------------------
Any player who meets the following criteria:
- Has played more than 50 hours.
- Is relatively active in the realms.
- Has more than the equivalent of one transcendent skill spent in lessons.


How do I submit a classlead report:
-----------------------------------
When submissions are open you may CLASSLEAD NEW <skill> <ability> to create a
new report. This will inform you if it has been successful, and give you a
report# to use for further modification. If you are not submitting a problem
with an existing skill, please use "NEW" as the ability name.

From here, you will need to fill in the details of the report, using the

 - Use this to describe the problem with the ability. The more concise
   you can be, the higher the chances of the report being actioned.

- CLASSLEAD <#> SOLUTION <1-3> <text>
 - List up to 3 solutions to the problem, again, be as concise as
   possible. You do not need to flesh out every detail, we will contact
   you further in the event your report is actioned if we need more
   details.

- CLASSLEAD <#> SUBMIT
 - Submits your classlead report. Once this is done, it becomes locked
   for editing, and becomes accessible to any player to look over.

-- Note: You may only have five (5) classlead reports at any time, per
   cycle. If you do not SUBMIT your classleads, they will not be considered
   as a part of the current cycle.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. There are 2 Baarian tiger cubs here. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Balancing on her long legs is a giraffe calf. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 2 guardian angels here.  Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, a determined glint in his eyes. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

Report #265
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by: Hirst          Status      : Submitted
Skill       : Spirituality   Ability     : Refuge
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Refuge can be used as a nigh unstoppable way to avoid combat or escape, allowing the user to continue to heal both health and afflictions without stopping it. There is also no 3rd-party message to tell attackers that the person is refuging. This also applies to Apostaty refuge as well
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make any action, curing or sipping, stop refuge.
Solution #2:
Show a 3rd party message so actions can be forced or attempts made to stop the refuge
Solution #3:
Do both solutions 1 & 2

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. There are 2 Baarian tiger cubs here. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Balancing on her long legs is a giraffe calf. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 2 guardian angels here.  Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, a determined glint in his eyes. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Oathsworn Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. There are 2 Baarian tiger cubs here. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Balancing on her long legs is a giraffe calf. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 2 guardian angels here.  Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Oathsworn Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, a determined glint in his eyes. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.

Problem:
Like Tesha's classlead number 278, I think that Devotion users, and their cities, has no meaningful way of infiltration, save for phased serpents which are easily stopped.  To be viable in a raiding sense, we would need something akin to astral or blackwind.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give devotion users Lightform, which obviously will have a delay and will allow them to travel, undetected.  Obviously it will have the same restrictions as Astral form and blackwind.
Solution #2:
Allow a Priest's angel to travel, alone, to a desired location and summon the Priest/Priestess to them, akin to Pathfinder.
Solution #3:

The Dawnblade

From the watery islets of Targossas, the thunderous might of the Dawnblade
resounds. Focused upon the ideals of Mastery, Excellence, and Heroism, they are
the revered warriors of the sacred cause: defending the weak, protecting the
innocent, and upholding the sanctity of Targossas.

Specifically, the Dawnblade focus upon the mastery of their respective skills,
seeking combat excellence. Through dedication, and an understanding of time's
influence, the House drives forward in a constant effort to protect the tenets
of Good. Those of the Dawnblade believe that the enemies of Creation must be
expunged from the lands in order for Creation to remain in its most natural
state: the only way forward is to scourge the realm of these vermin. Thus, its
forces are required to actively defend Targossas, and partake in the physical
eradication of Evil, Darkness, and Chaos.
