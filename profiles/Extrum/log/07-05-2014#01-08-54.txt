The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

9.42 APOSTASY

The hallmark skill of the Apostate, Apostasy is the art and science of
summoning and dealing with the mighty Baalzadeens and lesser daemons. In it,
you will learn to use the sentient daeggers, form a relationship with your
loving Baalzadeen, and learn to summon a variety of lesser daemons into a
pentagram drawn with blood. Perhaps the most feared ability of the Apostasy
skill is that which allows your Baalzadeen to tear the soul from an unwilling
victim.

8.1.2 THE APOSTATE CLASS

In days long past, the armies of Evil plotted to open a rift to the daemon
planes through the torture and sacrifice of a holy guardian angel. However,
the angel was resurrected and the rift closed, but not before a daemon
general by the name of Morimbuul had come through the aperture. The daemon
general, enraged at his entrapment on the prime material plane, threatened
to destroy all around him. His summoner, a man named Xerimor, was able to
subdue him, and much to the daemon general's fury, forced Morimbuul to
instruct him in the daemonic arts. And thus was the class of Apostates born.

Apostates are diabolical scholars and ritualists in the service of Evil.
These black priests spread the teachings of the Gods of Evil throughout the
realm, and they also act as the spiritual pulse of Mhaldor, the city of
evil. Because of their devotion to Evil, they are rarely welcome in other
cities.

Through the skill of Apostasy, Apostates harness the power of the
daemonic realms. They may summon and command daemonic entities to do their
bidding, including living daemonic daeggers, bloodworms, nightmares, and
most importantly, the powerful baalzadeens. Their training in the dreadful
art of Necromancy grants them powers based upon draining life essence from
the hearts of mortals and using it for various spells, including even the
secret of guarding one's soul from death itself. These skills are
supplemented by the skill of Evileye, which allows Apostates to cause a
great number of terrible afflictions upon their enemies.

The skills wielded by those of Apostate class are Apostasy, Necromancy,
and Evileye. A fledgling in this class will possess Evileye and Necromancy,
gaining Apostasy upon embracing class.

** Please be advised that this class comes with restrictions on your
actions. The skills of Apostates are fuelled by daemonic and evil forces; if
you choose this class but act against such forces, you may find that your
ability to use such skills has been revoked.

9.3 NECROMANCY


Necromancy is the dark art of death magic. At the lower levels, there is an
assortment of rather nefarious abilities. Soon though, the ability of
Cannibalism is gained, a skill which has inspired wide-spread fear of those
practicing Necromancy. Through cannibalism, a Necromancer increases his life
essence, which powers the higher abilities. At the very highest level, a
Necromancer gains the power to protect his very soul from death.

** The Infestation and Frenzy abilities are Infernal only and the order is
different for the abilities below depending on whether you are an Apostate or
an Infernal **

9.41 EVILEYE

Evileye is a skill that is perhaps related to the Curses skill used by the
Shamans, albeit perhaps less powerful. With it, one may make eye contact with
an opponent and give them the 'evil eye', imposing a wide variety of
afflictions upon the opponent. At the high end of the ability, one learns the
craft of giving multiple afflictions simultaneously.
