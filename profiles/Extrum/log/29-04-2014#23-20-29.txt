A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a butchering cleaver in his right. The Silver Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms.

The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

Subject: Alchemist changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've spent the past few weeks really focussing on Alchemist combat, in efforts to make the entire experience a little more enjoyable and remove some of the more tedious elements. The details of the changes are as follows:

Physiology:
-----------
* The TEMPER FLUID mechanic has been removed, Alchemists will now directly temper specific humours. Each humour will reach its maximum potency after ten tempers.
* TRUEWRACK has been reworked to require minimum levels of humour tempering before being able to access certain afflictions.
* TEMPERing a humour will now have differing effects based on any persistent wracked afflictions.
* TEMPER balance cost has been decreased.
* INUNDATE has been significantly reworked, it will now remove all fluids and bestow an effect based on the level of the humour.
* Ginger will now cure one level of a tempered humour.
* EVALUATE now accepts the HUMOURS argument, which will allow you to see the humour levels at no balance or equilibrium cost.
* Homunculus with administered mercury has been reworked to no longer give passive fluid gain, instead affecting the victims ability to effectively eat herbs and minerals.
* Alchemists can now touch shield while off-balance from TEMPERing.

Alchemy:
--------
* COPPER has had it's equilibrium cost slightly increased. It will now also be further increased if you're off temper balance.

Salutations Argent Ward,

I just wanted to raise awareness that I am working on restructuring the clan a little. You will notice that there are only two positions now, Deputies and Infantry. Deputies may assist in inducting new members, and are invested with other important powers. So if there is somebody seeking entrance to the clan, you may direct them to myself or one of them.

As for all members, you will remain Infantry for now. If you wish to become a Deputy, it is mostly based off those who have attained Arbiter in the Dawnguard, so I suggust you work on that. But more importantly, when I first created this organization it was supposed to be 5-10 individuals, who I could count on to join in combat at a moments notice. Though we have grown largely and sort of taken an "insane" aspect to the clan, this requirement is still mandatory. If you cannot agree to CLHELP REQUIREMENTS, then this likely is not the right clan for you.

As for general information on the clan, this is not a combat academy. The original idea was a more elite clan of combatants, and I am not saying we have strayed from this, but we should keep it this way. If one is seeking to learn combat, kindly direct them to the Dawnguard.

If you have any ideas for bettering the clan, or opinions on the changes don't hesitate to message me.

Remain in strength,
Zuko Shu'in-Crescent, Monk of the Watch

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  The Silver Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is riding on a giant tortoise. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a butchering cleaver in his right.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

After reaching a certain threshold of fashions (40? Not sure of the number), all reasonable puppet skills become invisible if used out of room.
Solution #3:
Allow to specify which skills you would like to hide at use time, with a heavier fashion use (puppet slow masked or something)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision:
Slow to be hidden out of room - sure.

Skill       : Pranks         Ability     : Hocuspocus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hocuspocus is the only illusion ability - other than Creator which is easily overcome due to the immediate incidence after flinging it from adjacent with a doppleganger - that affects the user of the Illusion. The need for overly complex scripting in order for the Jester to avoid their own hocuspocus illusions is tedious considering this could be achieved by a small overhaul to the way Hocuspocus works.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the Jester to see their own Hocuspocus akin to "You observe your Hocuspocus\n<hocuspocus here>".
Solution #2:
Solution #3:

Report #207
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by: Jovolo         Status      : Approved                 Priority : -2
Skill       : Artefacts      Ability     : Thoth's fang
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
This is similar to the problem posed in classlead 206. However, Thoth's Fang should be considered separately from the Torc of Telepathy, as it is more easily hindered - Clumsiness, Crippled Arms, Shield and Rebounding - however, it can deliver high priority afflictions such as paralysis, limb damage and physical damage at an incredibly fast rate (Faster than herb balance). As the affliction rate of Thoth's fang, combined with entities, is consequentially faster than what Occultist is balanced around (instill), it becomes an unreasonable situation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make Thoth's fang unusable while off entity balance, and if entity balance is used while off balance from a jab with either Thoth's fang or any weapon, scale the balance recovery to, at minimum, match entity balance. To further elaborate on this, someone jabbing with a weapon faster than entity balance who then uses entity balance before they recover limb balance from the jab, would see their balance recovery extended to match their entity balance. Someone jabbing with a weapon that is slower than entity balance would recover at exactly the same time as they typically would - after they regain entity balance.
Solution #2:
Solution #3:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision:
I don't like the solution here (kind of messy), but I will be investigating the use of nonclass based weaponry with tertiary balances this round.

Problem:
Even with the advantage of juggled axes, curing has caught up to handling aeon and removed some of the kill potential of jester.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add more skills to the list of puppetry/vodun that are hidden out of room. In particular slow and strip.
Solution #2:
After reaching a certain threshold of fashions (40? Not sure of the number), all reasonable puppet skills become invisible if used out of room.
Solution #3:
Allow to specify which skills you would like to hide at use time, with a heavier fashion use (puppet slow masked or something)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision:
Slow to be hidden out of room - sure.

Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : Fashions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
I feel like fashioning should do something more to help to defend the shaman just a tiny bit when fashioning and can be useful in raids, if used properly, as well as other strategies specifically with bleeding and possibly even inflame.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Have fashioning drain a tiny bit of man from the target with each fashion and maybe twice the amount when you get a truefashion. Alternatively, instead of mana it could possibly have some other draining effect such as willpower, endurance, health, or a minor bleed. I feel this could differ Vodun from Puppetry just a bit and show the "mystical" side of Vodun and it's link to the persons "life essence"
Solution #2:
Have fashioning like normal up to a certain point and than drain mana or have some other minor effect on the target based on the amount of fashions you have acquired. I feel this could give fashioning a "dangerous" feel and can offer some warning to the target of how far into fashioning they are as well as showing the mystical side of vodun.
Solution #3:
Have fashioning remain the same as it is now because we all know it is still awesome either way.

Not something we're considering at this time.

Submitted by: Achimrst       Status      : Rejected
Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Shaman don't do damage, we fashion and we afflict so we are left to resort to various methods to work a Tzantza in and get a head or bleed them to death, possibly asphixiate them. In short Shamans to little to no actual damage, so I would like to try and fix that for some added strategies and fun to have with Vodun.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
An ability to replace vodun bleed, or a change really, so that a certain amount of bleeding can be caused instantly while destroying the doll based on how many fashions. Of course it would have to be balanced out based on how many fashions are on the doll. This disables the Shaman when used if they do not have enough fashions to actually kill a person. It is also abuseable by those who can force to get rid of a doll, so it can either stay that way or it cannot be forceable to use it.
Solution #2:
An ability to slit the persons throat as an option to cause even more bleeding on top of salve balance options already given and Vodun Bleed and more ways to incorporate Curse Inflame as a burst damage option.
Solution #3:
A re-work of Vodun Leech into an ability that works similarly to healthleech and/or manaleech maybe even just taking a portion of the person's sip amount and giving it to the shaman.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision:
Shaman should be getting some adjustments in an upcoming project.

Problem:

Remove the cost and requirements of vodun status and add make such information available to the caster when the doll is probed. In addition, display amount of bleeding damage and afflictions present on the current target's doll.

Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : Illusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Vodun illusion was one of the earliest forms of sympathetic magick roleplayed by shamans in the original Shamans Guild. Per Firefox, vision quests often involved the youngling roleplaying a long journey somewhere unfamiliar on prime plane and the mentor illusioning wonderful bits to help guide their walk in the class. Today, that's all vodun illusion is good for anymore. Its combat effectiveness has been totally stripped away for those utilizing server-side curing with Announce 4103.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Similar to the bonus given to serpents, give shamans the ability to fashion faster.
Solution #2:
Make the number of fashions gained completely randomized (somewhere between 1-4 fashions per tick), with truefashion being re-worked to allow dolls to remain fashioned slightly longer (without the mandatory 1-hour decay time).
Solution #3:
Allow shamans to curse faster.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have some plans for shaman in the works to address these issues.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Just as submitted in Classlead 191, I also feel that illusions are an important aspect of Vodun and Shaman combat. My problem is that without it to help to deflect curing we should have some sort of rework to other abilities and a rework of how illusion is used now!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Have illusion cost no fashions what-so-ever and simply be useable upon creating a doll. Lower the fashions needed for Blackout of not replace illusion in fashion cost and use. I feel that with the fashion cost for blackout lowered the class itself will rather use blackout than illusions.
Solution #2:
Have illusion cost no fashions what-so-ever and simply be useable upon creating a doll. Have puncture cause a state 2 torso break at 20 fashions with 4 used.

Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : Bloodeffigy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Fashioning leaves Shamans wide open to attack, but unlike jesters, shamans have few reliable active or passive defenses (ie. hangedman for hindering, acrobatics, backhandspring, timers for bombs), and compared to Runewardens, Shamans don't have passives such as weathering, resistance and a lower armor class to offset higher damage input. It is necessary to bring the class in line with others as far as momentum and defenses are concerned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Create a new ability in Vodun called Bloodeffigy, which is a passive ability that has a high chance upon cursing a target to extract a small amount of blood from them, transmuting the lifeblood into the making of the vodun doll, strengthening it with fashions. The blood effigy could also provide a life-link between the shaman and the doll, allowing a percentage of damage reduction based on intelligence and number of fashions on the doll. This will give shamans an alternative to "fashion ad nauseum hit and run strategies" and would build incentive for more direct combat.

something else creative to bolster defenses and rework current class mechanics.

Report #43
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by: Jovolo         Status      : Approved                 Priority : 2
Skill       : Pranks         Ability     : Hocuspocus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hocuspocus is the only illusion ability - other than Creator which is easily overcome due to the immediate incidence after flinging it from adjacent with a doppleganger - that affects the user of the Illusion. The need for overly complex scripting in order for the Jester to avoid their own hocuspocus illusions is tedious considering this could be achieved by a small overhaul to the way Hocuspocus works.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the Jester to see their own Hocuspocus akin to "You observe your Hocuspocus\n<hocuspocus here>".
Solution #2:
Solution #3:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decision:
Sure, no objections.

Problem:
At the moment there is no indication of who is throwing a bomb at you when a group is standing in an adjacent room. It might be a jester or some novice who got some bombs handed to them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Implement a 3rd party message on who threw the bomb on all bombs.

Submitted by: Jovolo         Status      : Approved                 Priority : 2
Skill       : Pranks         Ability     : Hocuspocus
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hocuspocus is the only illusion ability - other than Creator which is easily overcome due to the immediate incidence after flinging it from adjacent with a doppleganger - that affects the user of the Illusion. The need for overly complex scripting in order for the Jester to avoid their own hocuspocus illusions is tedious considering this could be achieved by a small overhaul to the way Hocuspocus works.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the Jester to see their own Hocuspocus akin to "You observe your Hocuspocus\n<hocuspocus here>".
Solution #2:
Solution #3:

Decision:

Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Soldier Shiro is here.

So the chances of losing your weapons kind of outweighs the benefits of seeking extraordinary and expensive weapons. The following solution would help alleviate that by sparing the expense of repurchasing weapons constantly.

Add a type of boomerang effect to juggled weapons that returns them to your inventory after thrown. The returned items wouldn't be juggled any longer and it wouldn't apply to bombs for obvious reasons.
Solution #2:
same as solution one, but add it as a perk for transcending similar to juggling 3 items.
Solution #3:
Same deal as solution 1, but added as a separate skill.

Problem:
Jester is one of the only classes, if not the only class, that does not have pvp damage reductions. The class used to rely heavily on dodging and escaping, but dodging took a heavy hit when Monk(The last real victim of dodging) got an accuracy boost as well as an easy workaround to dodging.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The "give bomb to target" reflex is pretty ridiculous. It's a one of a kind issue where an opponent can turn your own attack on you with ease and capitalize on it. While opponents do need a chance to escape bombs, they don't need so many. There are currently 3 actions you can take to get rid of bombs.. 2 too many. You can put in a container, drop, or give it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make it so timed bombs cannot be placed into any container or given back. Attempts to do so would be met with a message stating "You cannot give that away." Or "You cannot put a live explosive in that." Additionally you could create an artifact container built to withstand explosions.
Solution #2:
Make it so that only the Jester can give away timed bombs. Leaving the only options to put it in a container or drop it. Any attempt by an opponent to give it back would be met with a message stating he/she cannot give that away.
Solution #3:
Add a new skill that allows a Jester to rig his or her explosives with a trick detonator that trips when the bomb is handled to give away or put in a container. Dropping is still viable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Given the fact that illusions are now obsoleted, Jester needs to compensate for that. A large part of combat for it was using illusions to deceive the opponent into doing something like disrupting aeon curing by illusioning something like asthma or sleep. It was also useful to buy time by forcing the opponent to lose balance, defenses are upkept and managed by the curing, so speed might be an issue aswell. It's been kind of a "trick" class, even though I hate to call it that, but now with the impact this has, the trick part is gone. We might as well take something beneficial from this and cross over into a more solid affliction class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Create a new prop that can be wished for to deliver impatience.
Solution #2:
Remove the random factor from Itchpowder and replace it with a steady 2s tick that afflicts with Impatience.
Solution #3:
Give juggling a separate balance cost, similar to how dstab+illusion used to work. This would allow combat to proceed as it was without the need for an illusion to throw off aeon curing.

Solution #1:
Increase Throttle damage to scale more with artefacts so it reaches Kai Choke levels of strength.
Solution #2:
Put a timer between sipping Levitation and the defence coming up, like sipping Speed, so that balloonhandoff + throwing butterfly bombs is a tiny bit more effective.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The effects of the Devil card wear off entirely too fast, and they're a one-time use for Jesters, whereas Occultists get multiple Devil flings with the use of Devilmark.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the effects of Devil to be stacked up to 3x, so that flinging 3 Devils in a row will give you the Devil card effect 3x, but they wear off at the current rate.
Solution #2:
Give Jesters a devil-mark type ability.
Solution #3:
Create an ability for Jesters that, instead of throwing 2 cards under the effects of devil, has a chance of throwing 1 card and afflicting with asthma simultaneously.

While we acknowledge jesters may struggle to utilise devil affectively, we also don't think it an overly necessary component of the jester offense.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption is here, serene. He wields a Raphaelan mace in his left hand and a butchering cleaver in his right.

6655h, 4760m, 30570e, 21375w cekdb-
A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A small wooden lottery box stands here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub.  Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

Nearing Lake Vundamere (road).
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A small wooden sign is nailed crookedly to a post here. Miniature hands clasped patiently, a diminutive homunculus stands here, its features bearing an uncanny resemblance to Jhui. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the north. A spinning disc of deep claret crystal floats here. A spinning pentagon carved from a cloudy white crystal floats here. A stinking noxious cloud floats here. A fuzzy brown bunny quietly nibbles a blade of grass. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. A book lies on the floor, gathering dust. There are 2 pyramid crystals in 2 groups here. There are 2 spiral crystals in 2 groups here. A light smudge of green indicates a pinch of malachite dusts the ground here. Nearly hidden from view, a deep green crystalline cube lies here. There are 2 aurum flakes in 2 groups here. A dark grey flake of plumbum sparkles upon the floor. There are 3 disc-shaped crystals in 2 groups here. A pentagon carved from a cloudy white crystal lies here. There are 3 potash crystals in 3 groups here. A lustrous silver flake of antimony lies abandoned here.  The air visibly swirls around Sempai Gyrth Shiva, the Green Dragon, creating a vortex with him at the locus. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand. Sempai Fendrel Azon-Mercadia, Airborne Tiger is here. Warlord Jhui Ta'sa, Lord of the Crossing is riding on a giant eagle. Droccs is here. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is here.
