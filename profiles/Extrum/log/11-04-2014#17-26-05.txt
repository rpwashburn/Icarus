I thank you for all you've done for us,

Like a young girl
who barely knows how to live,
I find strength and beauty
in the lessons you give.
All my days I will treasure your precious book,
and I appreciate the time it took.
Like a flower worn proudly in a lady's hair,
I strive,
with the world watching,
to reach the goals writen there.

About Galos


When I think about Galos
I don't think of a lass.
But dream of a far away land
Similar to the Isle of Delos.

When I think about Galos
And ponder how she looks.
It dawns on me that I don't
Know how looks, my loss!

When I think about Galos
It does make me wonder.
For now she'll lose her
Mind. Because I thought

About Galos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lass of such beauty, untamed
Of such art.

Deserves a she, a pronoun to
Take her part.

But alas, this old fool, centuries
Old, forgot that

Pronoun - so the truth is told.

Bedazzled by wonders, appearance
Anew. A dazzling damsel

In the City of Blu.

My apologies now, most
Sincere and true,

For forgetting that she
Who stood in for you.

TARGOSSAS NEWS #278                                     (04/11/2014 at 14:35)  
From   : Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince
To     : The City of Targossas
Subject: The Ministry of Cultural Affairs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings,

The Bloodsworn and the Dawnlord have granted me the distinct honour of serving as the next Minister of Cultural Affairs. I am thankful for the oppurtunity and will strive to excel.

As usual, with such an appointment comes a call for aides. Those within the Ministry already who have expressed interest in remaining there have already been spoken to, but we need more! If you are interested feel free to speak to me at any time. For those new to the idea, I'll try to expand on the scope of the Ministry.

In essence the Ministry of Culture is in charge of morale in Targossas as well as running events and competitions for various reasons within the city. Due to the constant upkeep and continual nature of the job it can be one of the most demanding Ministries to actually work for, but also one of the most gratifying. Due to these factors it's probably best if I explain what character traits we're looking for when it comes to aides, as you are not going to be handed out tasks as you would normally think. You will be given more free reign than you are probably used to. So if you fit these three charactaristics talk to me about joining the Ministry of Culture today!

1) Free thinking: Due to the nature of the position, you'll be expected to come up with events and ideas on your own. If they are appropriate and fit the bill, we will come up with a way to accomplish them and ensure the right people are working with you to bring the task to fruition.

2) Hard work: This goes without saying. If you are able to apply yourself within the Ministry, you will be given more responsibility than those who believe the sole purpose of the Ministry is to run arena events. It's important that the Ministry is self-reliant and able to complete tasks within their own frame without needing someone to spoon feed you instructions.

3) An ability to consume unnecessary amounts of alcohol: This one is top secret and will be explained when/if you join the Ministry.

If you feel you have something to offer to the Ministry, and hold fun, hard work, and alcohol close to your heart come talk to me at anytime! Regardless of age or experience, you have a place within the Ministry. Together we can hopefully create a lasting environment for the city to come to outside of the war and death we most usually see at our city gates.

In Their service,

Micaelis Bayt al-Azhan
Minister of Culture

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Soldier Morthif Aristata is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. The Black Dragon Dannyl's imposing form looms. The Golden Dragon Epiphany's imposing form looms. Ernam, gate guard is here.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. The Golden Dragon Epiphany's imposing form looms. The Black Dragon Dannyl's imposing form looms. Soldier Morthif Aristata is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Dawnlord Silas Maynard, the Voice of Light is here. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. The Golden Dragon Epiphany's imposing form looms. Soldier Morthif Aristata is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Dawnlord Silas Maynard, the Voice of Light is here. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Ernam, gate guard is here. The Black Dragon Dannyl's imposing form looms.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.
