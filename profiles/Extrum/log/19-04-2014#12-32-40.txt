The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

Skill       : Seafaring      Ability     : Wavecall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Wavecall is used as a constant GTFO button and it completely negates any chance for naval conflict. It has no cooldown, has an absurd range, and provides no notification for anybody in pursuit. Wavecall should be for tactical movement and positioning, not a get out of jail free card.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Reduce the maximum range of wavecall and add a cooldown based on metrons traveled. For instance, 2s cooldown per metron moved.
Solution #2:
Add a 3rd party message to wavecall that other ships will see that displays the direction a ship wavecalled.
Solution #3:
Combine solutions 1 & 2

Skill       : Miscellaneous  Ability     : Worldburn
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Worldburn has become a standard go-to for city defense. It has no counter if the shrine is on city guards and no mechanism exists to prevent blanket coverage. Some people even use it for personal reasons such as ganks and contracts. The essence cost is negligible for large Orders and the willpower/endurance cost does not encourage smart, informed usage since a person can easily be killed and embrace death to regain their losses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give worldburn a cooldown. Once per Order per Achaean month is more than reasonable to discourage rampant use of such a powerful ability.
Solution #2:
Limit the number of shrines per Order that can be raised in an area to prevent blanket coverage of entire cities.
Solution #3:
Remove worldburn entirely to encourage use of other shrine powers such as healing.

Skill       : Seafaring      Ability     : Shipreturn
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The changes to islands to make them more secluded and profitable in terms of experience was needed but only served as a minor inconvenience with the advent of bronze toekns. People can still "farm" these locations for the improved experience as if they were never changed. Shipreturn should be modified slightly to encourage more ship sailing rather than turning ships into a safe refuge or hunting location
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Impose a limit to the number of returns possible before a ship must be moved to a NEW harbour and not just undocked and redocked at the same harbour. This will require people to actually put the effort into sailing to earn the benefits of outer island experience. Ships at sea are allowed unlimited returns so as to allow people to return to them if they should die during combat
Solution #2:
Give shipreturn a figurehead power cost such as 5-10%. This will force people to sail to maintain the benefits of shipreturn.

Problem:
The oceans are vast and finding other ships can be very tiresome and time-consuming, especially if crew on a ship do not have hours to invest in scouting. A new ability, much like Fullsense in Telepathy, would make hunting for ships more enjoyable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A new ability, in Watch or Command, that displays all undocked vessels in a particular region of ocean but not globally.
Solution #2:
Sonar ping. This new ability would send out a pulse in the local area, returning the general direction to any ships in that area. However, just like modern sonar pings, doing so will also alert these ships, giving them the time to sail away if they so desire. A figurehead cost of 5% or so would be reasonable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Bards can't fast travel. This is primarily a problem for bards.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
The troubadour ability would allow those who are trans Harmonics to call home their fellow class members, much the way delivery works for Devotion users. PLAY TROUBADOUR (target) would begin the process, and the target would PLAY ECHO to respond, to avoid griefing class members by calling them to the new location unawares.
Solution #2:
The troubadour ability would allow bards who are trans Voicecraft to call home their fellow class members, much the way delivery works for Devotion users. SING TROUBADOUR (target) would  begin the process, and the target would SING ECHO to respond, to avoid griefing class members by calling them to the new location unawares.
Solution #3:
Make it a voicecraft ability. i.e. SING TROUBADOUR (target) The power of your voice is so great that it creates a temporary portal between yourself and your target, but at a huge mana drain.

Skill       : Gathering      Ability     : Milk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
When gathering, adventurers get way more eggs than milk.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Change the ability to GATHER (eggs or milk) FROM FARM, allowing adventuers to toggle what they need to gather (still only allowing one gathering experience within the same timeframe)
Solution #2:
Alter the game specs so that adventuers have equal chance of gathering eggs or milk each time they gather from an area, so we don't wind up with subdivision houses filled with eggs that won't store in our rifts.
Solution #3:
Alter the game specs so that adventurers begin getting more milk than eggs, since milk has tons more uses and can be stored on vials for later use, making it a more valuable item on all levels.

Skill       : Seafaring      Ability     : Shipreturn
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
People have access to multiple ships, unlike when Seafaring was first introduced. It would be helpful to be able to toggle between a few different ones when ship returning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Tweak the SHIPRETURN ability, allowing adventurers to SHIPRETURN (ship short name or ID) for up to three ships.
Solution #2:
Add an ability called SHIPRECALL that allows adventurers to change their shipreturn to any ship where they are the owner or have captain perms without having to be onboard the ship at the time. To prevent abuse, it's only available once per RL day and comes with a slight mana drain so it can't be used immediately after the change.
Solution #3:
New artefact idea -- BROOCH OF THE HIGH SEAS (short - brooch of the high seas) (dropped - A brooch of the high seas is here, glittering like lost pirate's treasure.) (examined - Cast in the shape of a ship's anchor, a trio of gems lie like flotsam and jetsam along the bottom of the pin. Light sparkles in sequence upon the dazzling facets of the emerald, ruby, and sapphire stones. On the rear of the elegant accessory, a bit of scrawled text mars the otherwise smooth surface. // PURPOSE -- this would give 3 shipreturn "slots". // suggested commands -- SHIPRETURN HERE (gemstone) would set the shipreturn to that ship // SHIPRETURN WHERE (gemstone) reminds what's set at that gemstone // PUSH BROOCH (gemstone) toggles between shipreturn settings // WHY IT'S NEEDED -- some people have several ships, or access to several ships. When one is drydocked, it makes shipreturn a pain. To cut down on potential for abuse of a "quick travel" method, I suggest making the cost 800cr or taking a endurance/willpower hit similar to what one receives when using SHIP RESCUE ME with a token.

Posters dyed with ink are the same colour as everything else in the room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow posters to show up in the room to reflect the colour in which they are inked. (i.e. like streamers for the anniversary events)
Solution #2:
Allow text of a poster to show up reflecting the ink used to dye the poster.
Solution #3:
All of the above, because the realm could always use more colours.

Problem:
Transfix is only really useful to a mage for group combat situations. In 1v1, transfix is not considered to be strategically sound as other abilities could be used to better effect. Basically, there is no proper follow-up to transfixation for Magi to make it worth their while, even in retardation  and now that illusions are gone it's going to be hard to transfix properly... Therefor, now mages will have to work on getting transfix through use of venom stacking then trying to slip the transfix in. After all that hard work and they achieve the transfix...it's rather pointless to transfix because there is no decent follow up. This classlead addresses this issue
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Introduce a new ability "Disturbance" that Magi may cast upon a target that is transfixed. It will have a medium equilibrium cost (about 2.5s). Upon casting, the ability will deal magic damage (minor), epilepsy, stupidity and a 2 second stun. The stun and afflictions can hinder the foe and assist in putting them behind in curing (which mages really need help with at the moment, affliction power), and does minimal damage to start putting that damage momentum into place, and is fairly quick so the mage can flow back into their damage mode.

Skill       : Kaido          Ability     : Numbness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Numbess has become quite a standard in survivability in Monk combat and hunting. But it doesn't seem to cost the Monk anything to use. From what I've seen, within the 10s it's possible for them to cure to full before numbness wears off. And then they can usually heal back to full quickly after if they don't take at least 200% damage while numbed. And all the while, they can keep hitting their targets while numbed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a kai cost to the ability of 20 or so and make any offensive action force Numbness to come down.
Solution #2:
only allow sip healing or passive healing while numbness is up and incorporate a fairly significant Kai cost, like 40 kai or so.

Skill       : Kaido          Ability     : Numbness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Numbness is too spammable right now which leads to a monk being able to tank 20+ people for 10 seconds and probably past that too. The fact that it does not cost equilibrium to spam numb while already numbed allows the monk to spam numb in the last 2 seconds before it falls and then the monk will either re-enter numb with low health and can tank further 10 seconds or will starburst and re-enter numb immediately.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
if you try to NUMB while numbed then it will cost equilibrium as normal but will not extend the numb time at all.
Solution #2:
Implement a cooldown on numb so that you cannot numb again for 2 seconds after a previous numbness faded.

Skill       : Survival       Ability     : Breathing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently, the functionality of breathing allows an individual to negate asphyxiation damage at the cost of being unable to perform other actions. While this is a highly useful function, it could be tweaked slightly to allow individuals who might rely on asphyxiation damage an opportunity to secure a smaller chance of lethality, but remain balanced.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Tweak breathing to not be able to be used as a defense while you have a broken torso. Practically speaking, a broken or mangled torso would make it naturally difficult to hold your breath, especially when being attacked. The benefit allows asphyxiation damage to sneak through from a well-timed or well-calculated attack, but also provides a simple way for an individual to realize they have a broken or mangled torso.
Solution #2:
Allow asphyxiation damage to hit breathing as normal, negating the damage, but cause a short stun or disrupt. Not really a balanced solution, but can prevent individuals from relying too heavily on remaining only defensive.
Solution #3:
Not really many more options to come up with, nothing else seems very balanced, effective or fair compare to the first option.

Skill       : Domination     Ability     : Storm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The chaos storm is largely unused due to its overlap in function with the humbug. Yes, they are different mental afflictions, but one of these entities is sufficient.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Change the chaos storm to be a one time detonation per pact that creates a mini Chaos storm in the room in which it was detonated. The flavor would be similar to the Chaos storm evoked by the Babelonian ritual of the storm, but it would cause minor damage to everyone in the room.

Skill       : Necromancy     Ability     : Soulspear
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Soulspears are incredibly easy to come by and are easily the most dominant force in line of sight encounters. Their availability coupled with their ability to prone and impale from line of sight is a bit much.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Have a cap on the amount of soulspears that a necromancer can carry. Five or so, perhaps.
