Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. A small grey-brown rattlesnake is coiled here, rattling menacingly. There are 4 throwing axes here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Sir Antonius Agarwaen, Inquisitor of Heretics is here. He wields a mithril-hilted rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

Problem:
The "give bomb to target" reflex is pretty ridiculous. It's a one of a kind issue where an opponent can turn your own attack on you with ease and capitalize on it. While opponents do need a chance to escape bombs, they don't need so many. There are currently 3 actions you can take to get rid of bombs.. 2 too many. You can put in a container, drop, or give it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make it so timed bombs cannot be placed into any container or given back. Attempts to do so would be met with a message stating "You cannot give that away." Or "You cannot put a live explosive in that." Additionally you could create an artifact container built to withstand explosions.
Solution #2:
Make it so that only the Jester can give away timed bombs. Leaving the only options to put it in a container or drop it. Any attempt by an opponent to give it back would be met with a message stating he/she cannot give that away.
Solution #3:
Add a new skill that allows a Jester to rig his or her explosives with a trick detonator that trips when the bomb is handled to give away or put in a container. Dropping is still viable.

Problem:
Jester is one of the only classes, if not the only class, that does not have pvp damage reductions. The class used to rely heavily on dodging and escaping, but dodging took a heavy hit when Monk(The last real victim of dodging) got an accuracy boost as well as an easy workaround to dodging.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Implement PVP damage reduction to Slipperiness making it reduce damage in a similar fashion to scales.
Solution #2:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Jester is an expensive class to play in terms of buying commodities, cards, props, and weapons frequently. The burden really comes when weapons thrown get lost or stolen by an opponent. So the chances of losing your weapons kind of outweighs the benefits of seeking extraordinary and expensive weapons. The following solution would help alleviate that by sparing the expense of repurchasing weapons constantly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a type of boomerang effect to juggled weapons that returns them to your inventory after thrown. The returned items wouldn't be juggled any longer and it wouldn't apply to bombs for obvious reasons.
Solution #2:
same as solution one, but add it as a perk for transcending similar to juggling 3 items.
Solution #3:
Same deal as solution 1, but added as a separate skill.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
currently, Shamans have no way to track the current bleed on their target reliably. I suggest changes to the ability of Vodun status which has little actual utility in its current form.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove the cost and requirements of vodun status and add make such information available to the caster when the doll is probed. In addition, display amount of bleeding damage and afflictions present on the current target's doll.
Solution #2:
Keep vodun status requirements and fashions the same but also display amount of bleeding damage and afflictions present on the current target's doll.
Solution #3:
Keep vodun status requirements and fashions the same but also display amount of bleeding damage of the current target's doll.

Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A small grey-brown rattlesnake is coiled here, rattling menacingly. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. The Black Dragon Dannyl's imposing form looms.

Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A pygmy jarbo hops around with endless energy. A clouded leopard cub crouches nearby, keeping a close eye on her surroundings. A crested penguin stands proudly at attention.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
An eye-catching Year 650 banner ripples gently here. Silken violet streamers have been tied here, dancing merrily upon any breeze. A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. A whippet of a girl dashes around the barracks, cradling the stump of her left arm. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. A whippet of a girl dashes around the barracks, cradling the stump of her left arm. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

19.10.4 Stats Altering Artefacts

(see also HELP ARTEFACTS, HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS, HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for
the owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone
else's inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell
them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.

Created by Phaestus and given a soul by Proteus in return for Phaestus's eternal loyalty, dwarves are doughty and loyal humanoids. Grouped in clans from the central Siroccian Mountains to Inbhir Ness in the far north and the Vasnari Mountains of Meropis, they prefer the relative solitude of the highlands to the hustle and bustle of cities. Nevertheless, they are often found in leadership positions as everyone has heard the maxim: dependable as a dwarf.

Dwarves are unmistakably stocky, with muscular builds that retain their strength even into extreme old age. Skinny or slender dwarves are very rare. Most stand around four feet short, though there are rare cases of giant dwarves who grow to reach human height. Their skin tone is naturally pale or ruddy, but those with tanned and dark skin are not unheard of, and their facial features are rounded, often with button or bulbous noses. Beards are prevalent among male dwarves, and most consider a long, thick beard to be a mark of pride. Many of the females can grow beards as well, though they have a tendency to remove their facial hair. Red or dark hair is very common, though blond is not particularly unusual, and it is generally thick and/or curly in texture. The eyes, too, are typically dark (brown or black) but many have blue, green, or grey eyes as well.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. A whippet of a girl dashes around the barracks, cradling the stump of her left arm. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. A whippet of a girl dashes around the barracks, cradling the stump of her left arm. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. There are 2 gold-breasted falcons here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A pygmy jarbo hops around with endless energy. A clouded leopard cub crouches nearby, keeping a close eye on her surroundings. A crested penguin stands proudly at attention. Balancing on her long legs is a giraffe calf. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A noble snow-white falcon glides to and fro here. There are 2 guardian angels here.  Brivius is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Dannyl Maynard is here. Soldier Morthif Aristata is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields an Auroran Mace in his left hand. Hanley D'Ischai is here, shrouded. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. Dawnlord Silas Maynard, the Voice of Light is here.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A small grey-brown rattlesnake is coiled here, rattling menacingly. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Kray Sehr'asa is riding on a storm bull.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A small grey-brown rattlesnake is coiled here, rattling menacingly. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

He is wearing a canvas backpack, a suit of scale mail, a shimmering crystal clover, an earring of Sinope through his right ear, a commemorative brooch, a stained glass pendulum, a ring of flying, a pair of buckawn's boots, a Mayan ring, an assassin's cloak of black cotton with the hood raised, a small iron sheath, an earring of Sinope through his left ear, an iron belthook, a sand-dusted quiver, and a bag of stasis.

He is a stout dwarf. He is tall for his race, almost the height of a short human. He walks with a slight hunch, as if scarred from some past battle. His eyes, steel in colour, flash out from beneath a deep set brow, absorbing every detail of his surroundings before moving on. His black hair is grown long down his back, and tied up in a pony tail. He is light skinned, which is unusual for his race. Scars cover much of his body, contorting beneath his muscles. On his left forearm is a luminous silhouette of an ivory dragon in flight. He is wearing a canvas backpack, a suit of scale mail, a shimmering crystal clover, an earring of Sinope through his right ear, a commemorative brooch, a stained glass pendulum, a ring of flying, a pair of buckawn's boots, a Mayan ring, an assassin's cloak of black cotton with the hood raised, a small iron sheath, an earring of Sinope through his left ear, an iron belthook, a sand-dusted quiver, and a bag of stasis. He bears the burden of the true disfavour of Vastar.

You are:
deaf.

suffused with the void.
6032h, 4298m, 27235e, 19716w cxkdb-
On the clouds (indoors).
A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. A small black cobra is flaring its hood here. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and in.

The empty grasp of the void retreats, and you breathe more easily.
6032h, 4352m, 27155e, 19718w cxkdb-
Fendrel flies up from the ground, carried by a pair of eagle's wings that flare with power.

You begin to wield a Shield of Absorption in your left hand.
6032h, 4342m, 27175e, 19730w cexkdb-
Your action causes the nearly invisible magical shield around you to fade away.
Adding further detail to the puppet of Fendrel, you work on defining the nose, ears, eyes, and mouth.

He is a tiger-like rajamala. Standing at six feet, his fur is white and reminiscent of fallen snow. His face is framed with flyaway hair, and piercing blue eyes glitter from underneath a low brow. His complexion is fair, and while no scars mar his exterior, small blemishes and discolourations on his fur stand out. Thick, toned muscles on his arms give evidence of manual labour, and claws that have been meticulously trimmed glint dangerously in the available light. A long, swaying tail completes the image, as it occasionally moves and twitches about his lithe body. He is wearing a sturdy, hooded, hunter green riding cloak, knee length silver combat boots, a canvas backpack, a finely woven tabard, an ornate ivory scabbard, a pair of soft, grey leather gloves, a silver intricately scaled serpent hoop through his septum, an indigo-hued quiver with accents of gold and ebon, a black leather kilt, a black leather baldric, an iron belthook, a small iron sheath, a leather backstrap, a pirate's eyepatch, a suit of scale mail, a sky blue shoulder scabbard etched with silver runes, a hunter's belt, a Ceylonese bracelet, and a fire pendant.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Soldier Iskla Rian is here.

Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Standing quietly nearby is a beautiful silver mazaran. There are 3 giant eagles here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 5 cedar chairs with a covering of bright blue fabric here. Sempai Fendrel Azon-Mercadia, Tornoch First is here. Warlord Jhui Ta'sa, Lord of the Crossing is riding on a giant eagle.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.

A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Elode stands here with a soft smile on her face. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A small black squirrel watches the surroundings with interest. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  You see a sign indicating there are WARES for sale here.

Blackstone military quarter.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

Blackstone military quarter.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

Blackstone military quarter.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Terra a'Bertal is here. She wields an elemental staff in her left hand.

An obsidian eye sigil is here. There are 7 throwing axes here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Terra a'Bertal is here.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Terra a'Bertal is here. She wields an elemental staff in her left hand.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.

From   : Tyrannus Ruth Yuridja-Keyte, Sartai Navarch
To     : Dawnlord Silas Maynard, the Voice of Light
Subject: Your political grandstanding
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Though called by a different name now, let us not deceive ourselves into believing that the re-founded city of Light has actually twisted far from its roots, Dawnlord. While you speak of the absence of despair and then of the perseverance that drives your forces, most of the world watches, unsurprised, as you ignore the familiar stench of apathy that festers within your servants of Creation.

You proudly tout the perception that the Dawnspear draws its strength from its purpose, yet observations proved that there was naught but ashes within the hearts of your sheep. With great amusement, I witnessed as many of your flock buried themselves deep into slumber within their personal cesspits, only digging themselves out to serve properly when the Bloodsworn's gift of an Academy sparked a renewal of the 'purpose' Targossas had seemingly sworn to.

For certain, this city of yours has no quarrel with Nature nor the mountain people of Cyrene. Yet, to claim you would stand alone in your defense of Creation is a falsehood that I believe even your ardents would have difficulty supporting when your pikemen prove otherwise. I applaud you and the Bloodsworn, however, for seeking to emulate the rule of Evil in the West by constantly striving to adapt a militaristic outlook and a religious outreach in your own organizations.

At least within Mhaldor, we are honest as to the methods we utilize to reach the heights of perfection. We offer chains of slavery to those who choose to abandon their relative freedom for service under the Seven Truths. By taking up God's will as our yoke, we work as one to carve out the land, ridding it of the leeches, the infirm, the unwilling and the weak so that it fits His image of a perfect world, one dominated by the disciplined, the honed and the strong.

Unfortunately, there are those who still continue to breed and nurture those who would sully Lord Sartan's planet with flagrant weakness and behaviours.

Therefore, as you do so rightly lament, Maynard, "these are the choices we make."

His Eternally,
Tyrannus Ruth Yuridja-Keyte

Blackstone military quarter.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.

She is a beautiful siren. Her appearance is slender, with high cheekbones slightly exaggerated by a warming flush spreading over her skin. Tiny lines edge the outer corners of emerald green eyes, belying her age behind a simple pair of eyeglasses. She moves with a graceful ease and lithe strength. Near her left shoulder, resting just above her collarbone, her smooth skin is interrupted by a blistered scar, fading slowly amid the healing process. Long auburn curls trail down her back, gathered with a simple ribbon into a neat mass of ringlets. She is wearing a canvas backpack, a ring of Divine Justice, a Veil of the Libertine, a white gold and ruby engagement ring, an earring of Sinope through her right ear, a white-gold and ruby wedding band, a silver quill brooch, a crisp white dress, a feminine pair of white high heeled shoes, a necklace of purity, a ranger's bow, a pair of horn-rimmed glasses, an indigo-hued quiver with accents of gold and ebon, a Collar of Diablerie, an Aldar Diadem, an Epicurean Sash, a Ceylonese bracelet, a hunter's belt, and a Mayan ring.

Blackstone military quarter.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An obsidian eye sigil is here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Terra a'Bertal is here. She wields an elemental staff in her left hand and an ornate steel rapier in her right.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.

19.5 BUGS, IDEAS, AND TYPOS

There will be times when you want to speak to the administration to:
- report a bug (an error in the game),  (command: BUG)
- report a typo in the game,            (command: TYPO)
- to ask a specific question,           (command: ISSUE)
- or to give them an idea for the game. (command: IDEA)

Bugs
----
The command is BUG <your bug report here>. Please give as much detail as
possible. Tell us when, and how it happened. Tell us what happened before. Tell
us if anything changed recently. The more detail you give, the better chance we
have of finding and fixing your problem. Make sure that you report exactly and
ONLY one bug each time you use this command.

Bug Don't
---------
- Try to avoid 'um' and 'er' and 'I don't know if this is a bug but' -
  they don't help any, and we've already got so much to read. Have mercy!
- Don't just quote something without comment, like "THe blarg walks in."
  Tell us that the "H" shouldn't be capitalised, or that there is no such
  thing as a blarg, or whatever you think the problem is.
- Don't tell us to fix it ASAP, or whatever. We promise we'll get to it
  as fast as we can, taking into account all the bugs already reported.
- Don't tell us that something doesn't make sense, or isn't logical, or
  is a bug. We know that you think that. You're reporting a bug, right?

You are pulled to the east by an unseen force.
A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. Magnificent and terrible, a towering green wyvern surveys her surroundings with a haughty, serpentine glare. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground.  Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right. Dannyl Maynard is here. He wields an ebony shield in his right hand. Oathsworn Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Predicant Kaiu Silvertongue-Obuun is here. She wields a mighty butcher's cleaver in her left hand. The Silver Dragon Draekar's imposing form looms. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here. He wields an Auroran Mace in his left hand. Terra a'Bertal is here. She wields an elemental staff in her left hand and an ornate steel rapier in her right. Hanley D'Ischai is here, shrouded. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a buckler in his left hand and an iron-tipped whip in his right. Soldier Ada Young is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground.  Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right. Oathsworn Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here.  Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  Kray Sehr'asa is riding on a storm bull. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  Kray Sehr'asa is riding on a storm bull. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right. Kray Sehr'asa is riding on a storm bull.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  Kray Sehr'asa is riding on a storm bull. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.

Subject: Depression
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've all been there - depressed for seemingly no reason and just looking for something to fill that emptiness inside.  So you go out the local pub, have a few drinks, find yourself a nice lady to take back to the Aureliana with you.  You wake up the next day and look over and realize you, literally, slept with a troll.  Immediately the twinges of regret and panic seize your entire body and you quickly look for an escape plan.  Trying to leave the scene quietly backfires as you step on a branch.  The troll awakens and it's just a full on sprint out of there.

Well, that was pretty much what it was like every day for months on end with the choice of joining forces with Mhaldor.  Thankfully, with a strong support group, I was able to see past that life and make the responsible decision of coming back home.

Thanks, guys.

A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. The imposing form of a powerful storm bull stands here, pawing impatiently at the ground.  Reonna is here. Predicant Carmell Bayt Al-Azhan, Caefir Priestess is riding on a noble hippogriff. She wields a bronze mace wreathed in flame in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in her right.
