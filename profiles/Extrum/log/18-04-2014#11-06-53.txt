A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow.  The Golden Dragon Tesha's imposing form looms.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

Surrounded by imposing walls, a granite courtyard spans outwards, cast in permanent shadow. Rising from a black marble fountain in the centre of the space is a large, perfectly sculpted statue. Holding daemonic hounds by a leash, the stonework depicts Lord Sartan, malevolently imposing even in this intangible scene, as he severs the head of some hapless mhun.

A grand old mansion rises to stand against a hazily represented mountainside, its windows lit from within by warm and glowing lanterns. The porch is strewn with comfortable wooden chairs and nearby tables that hold empty glasses and used ashtrays. Complete with an enormous brass knocker shaped into the face of a daemon, the door itself is a large mahogany slab. A torch over the door blazes with red glass panes, shining a crimson light out into a non-existent street.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here.  Soldier Aelios Azon stands here looking happy.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air. A headless corpse, devoid of identity, lies here.
