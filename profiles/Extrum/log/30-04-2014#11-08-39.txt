There is currently a City credit sale in progress.
----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

A dyed green poster fluttered on the road to Cyrene:

               A TASTE OF
             BAGWAR'S COPSE
                COMES TO

Finally! The brawny sailor breathed a sigh of relief. Even the chops at the edge of the world were a cinch compared to finding Cyrene beyond all these blasted mountains. If only there were ships that could sail right through the air and drop him splat down into the middle of the city.

Nothing for it now, though. Barely a month to go until the Grand Finale concert at the Beirdd hall.

A suspicion remained that this was some massive practical joke, fished up by the last captain he'd disobeyed. Him? A singer? Only to the tortoises in the sea and gulls in the air above Zanzibaar! A quest to find a soloist to perform in Cyrene sounded like a fool's errand.

Still. That Phelia Traseran had been so earnest, and not at all annoying for a landlubber. It was hard to say no to her hopeful lavender eyes.

Citizens of Targossas,

Yen has kindly allowed me to rent her shop, "Yen's Fine Establishment of Wares". Currently it has a full set of tuns full of alchemically beneficial liquids for purchase with a discount for citizens of Targossas and a further discount for member of the Dawnguards.

Twenty-five percent of the profits made from this store will be donated to the city. If you find any of the tuns empty, please send me a message. Minerals will be in stock in the next couple of months.
