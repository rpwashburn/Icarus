The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Galleryn is here. He wields a pinewood vial in his right hand. Havyn Shu'in-Crescent, Augur of Light is here.

You quaff flagon after flagon of darkbrew, sending the room spinning at an endlessly increasing rate. Perhaps you should have stopped a few flagons ago, you wonder, after vomiting the contents of your final meal. Dizzily you fall to the ground, gasping for breath as all fades away.

Rising up in a billowing cloud of red fog is a fearsome figure, his features obscured by a long robe. All that can be seen is a crimson gem gleaming brightly from within the shadowy folds of the robe, and a cruel chuckle rumbles all around as you tremble in fear.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. The Silver Dragon Davio's imposing form looms.
You see a single exit leading down.

Problem:
The "give bomb to target" reflex is pretty ridiculous. It's a one of a kind issue where an opponent can turn your own attack on you with ease and capitalize on it. While opponents do need a chance to escape bombs, they don't need so many. There are currently 3 actions you can take to get rid of bombs.. 2 too many. You can put in a container, drop, or give it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make it so timed bombs cannot be placed into any container or given back. Attempts to do so would be met with a message stating "You cannot give that away." Or "You cannot put a live explosive in that." Additionally you could create an artifact container built to withstand explosions.
Solution #2:
Make it so that only the Jester can give away timed bombs. Leaving the only options to put it in a container or drop it. Any attempt by an opponent to give it back would be met with a message stating he/she cannot give that away.
Solution #3:
Add a new skill that allows a Jester to rig his or her explosives with a trick detonator that trips when the bomb is handled to give away or put in a container. Dropping is still viable.

Problem:
Given the fact that illusions are now obsoleted, Jester needs to compensate for that. A large part of combat for it was using illusions to deceive the opponent into doing something like disrupting aeon curing by illusioning something like asthma or sleep. It was also useful to buy time by forcing the opponent to lose balance, defenses are upkept and managed by the curing, so speed might be an issue aswell. It's been kind of a "trick" class, even though I hate to call it that, but now with the impact this has, the trick part is gone. We might as well take something beneficial from this and cross over into a more solid affliction class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Create a new prop that can be wished for to deliver impatience.
Solution #2:
Remove the random factor from Itchpowder and replace it with a steady 2s tick that afflicts with Impatience.
Solution #3:
Give juggling a separate balance cost, similar to how dstab+illusion used to work. This would allow combat to proceed as it was without the need for an illusion to throw off aeon curing.
