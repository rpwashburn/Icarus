The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

There is currently a City credit sale in progress.
----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

ANNOUNCE NEWS #4126                                     (05/07/2014 at 16:20)

Subject: Changes to WALK TO/Landmarks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some changes today to make using Landmarks/WALK TO more useful.

1. Got rid of the Traveler Trait and the In Service Trait. If you had them, you'll be able to choose another now.

2. Got rid of the Magnetic Needle SoW item. If you had it, you should have 2 extra crowns now (what they cost).

3. Greatly increased WALK TO speed.

4. Everyone can now, by default, walk to where a living citymate or housemate is standing. Just WALK TO <person>.

5. The limit on custom landmarks has been upped. It used to be only 5 before you had to pay 100 lessons per additional mark. It's now 15.

Enjoy!

Penned by My hand on the 4th of Aeguary, in the year 654 AF.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 ebony pegasi here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A caparisoned charger stands nearby. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.
