Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. The sound of a low growl draws attention to Gunholf, a winged wolf. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A frisky goat kid bounds about. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. The sound of a low growl draws attention to Gunholf, a winged wolf. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A frisky goat kid bounds about. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. The sound of a low growl draws attention to Gunholf, a winged wolf. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A frisky goat kid bounds about. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A steel-plated chair is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 2 guardian angels here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A fiery efreeti spins madly here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Purest Heart Dhaia Bayt al-Azhan is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her right hand. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Soldier Iskla Rian is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. There are 2 guardian angels here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Soldier Iskla Rian is here. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Purest Heart Dhaia Bayt al-Azhan is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her right hand. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Soldier Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. The soul of Siduri roams the land, bodiless.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. There are 2 guardian angels here. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light.  Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Soldier Iskla Rian is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Purest Heart Dhaia Bayt al-Azhan is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her right hand. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Soldier Iskla Rian is here. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A nebulous water weird is here. There are 3 throwing axes here.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. There are 3 throwing axes here.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Phantom Asp, Siduri Azagnanna is here. She wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Predicant Lyndee Faelithar is here. She wields a sapphire-inlaid shield in her left hand and a silver staff of the elements in her right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Soldier Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Miharo, Faithful of Light is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. There are 12 throwing axes here.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Soldier Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded.

Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. The sound of a low growl draws attention to Gunholf, a winged wolf. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A frisky goat kid bounds about. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A bloodroot leaf lies here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. The sound of a low growl draws attention to Gunholf, a winged wolf. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A frisky goat kid bounds about. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A llama cria bounds energetically about the area. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A bloodroot leaf lies here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

A bustling farrier's yard.
A smattering of clouds fills the sky, lacing it with spiderwebs of grey. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 12 throwing axes here.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is seated here.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 12 throwing axes here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 12 throwing axes here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 12 throwing axes here. A nebulous water weird is here.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is seated here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. There are 12 throwing axes here. A nebulous water weird is here.  Miharo, Faithful of Light is here. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right.

Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.  The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.  Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded.

Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here. There are 2 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. Oathsworn Kadin is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and an elemental staff in his right.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A nebulous water weird is here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. High Advisor Micaelis Bayt Al-Azhan, Sefyric Prince is here, golden scales faintly shimmering over his form.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A nebulous water weird is here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. There are 14 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. There are 5 throwing axes here.  The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive.

Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. There are 5 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a Wyvern's Lash in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. There are 11 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a Wyvern's Lash in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a sharpened buckawn's spine in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right.

19.5 BUGS, IDEAS, AND TYPOS

There will be times when you want to speak to the administration to:
- report a bug (an error in the game),  (command: BUG)
- report a typo in the game,            (command: TYPO)
- to ask a specific question,           (command: ISSUE)
- or to give them an idea for the game. (command: IDEA)

Bugs
----
The command is BUG <your bug report here>. Please give as much detail as
possible. Tell us when, and how it happened. Tell us what happened before. Tell
us if anything changed recently. The more detail you give, the better chance we
have of finding and fixing your problem. Make sure that you report exactly and
ONLY one bug each time you use this command.

Bug Don't
---------
- Try to avoid 'um' and 'er' and 'I don't know if this is a bug but' -
  they don't help any, and we've already got so much to read. Have mercy!
- Don't just quote something without comment, like "THe blarg walks in."
  Tell us that the "H" shouldn't be capitalised, or that there is no such
  thing as a blarg, or whatever you think the problem is.
- Don't tell us to fix it ASAP, or whatever. We promise we'll get to it
  as fast as we can, taking into account all the bugs already reported.
- Don't tell us that something doesn't make sense, or isn't logical, or
  is a bug. We know that you think that. You're reporting a bug, right?


Bug Do

6344h, 4473m, 21559e, 20200w cexkdb-
You inhale deeply and begin holding your breath.
6344h, 4473m, 21559e, 20200w cexkdb-
You cease holding your breath and exhale loudly.
[File continued via MORE]
------
- Give lots of detail, if relevant.
- Stick to the facts. Tell us what you know, not how you feel about it.
- If there is a specific place where this bug happened, go there when
  you issue the bug command.
- If the bug didn't happen just a few moments before you are reporting
  it, then tell us when it was. We use GMT.


Bug Abuse
---------
If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! If you have found a way to
generate huge amounts of gold or experience by entering a single command over
and over, or if you are able to instantly kill people twice your level with one

punch, then you have probably encountered a bug. Please err on the side of
caution and report possible bugs, and refrain from exploiting the ones that
have
not yet been fixed. See HELP HONOUR.


Typos
-----
The command is TYPO <the typo you have seen>. This can be anything where there
is a misspelling or misused word. We really do want to hear about this sort of
thing, so don't be shy! Please include in your report what the error is and
where you saw it. If it is in an item or denizen please tell us that and
include the item##### if you can. This makes finding and correcting these typos
much faster and easier.

Questions
---------
Try contacting your house, city, or order patron. If you don't know how to do
this, or don't have any of those, try using ISSUE ME. See HELP ISSUES for more
details.


Ideas
-----
The command is IDEA <your idea here>. Submit your idea, in as great a detail as
you wish, and then wait. Who knows? You may see your idea affect the game. Many
have.

IDEA <text>   - Submit your idea.
LISTIDEAS     - List all ideas submitted by you.
SHOWIDEA <id> - Show full details on your submitted idea.


Viewing bugs
------------

logged that are still in the system.

BUGSUM - This will give you a tabular summary of the bugs you have
logged that are still in the system.

BUGAPPEND <id> <text> - This will let you append any extra information

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a sharpened buckawn's spine in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. There are 6 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a sharpened buckawn's spine in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. There are 6 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a sharpened buckawn's spine in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. There are 6 throwing axes here.  Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Golden Dragon Morthif's imposing form looms. Banek, of Targossas is riding on an ivory peryton. He wields a meteoric longsword in each hand. Apostle Daeir Wintermourne, Voice of the Fallen is here, impassive. He wields a sharpened buckawn's spine in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Deucalion in his right.
