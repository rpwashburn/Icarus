A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems. A caparisoned charger stands nearby. There are 2 ebony pegasi here. A fuzzy brown bunny quietly nibbles a blade of grass. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Serenie, a little snow-white dove, lingers here with curiosity and joy. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A clouded leopard cub crouches nearby, keeping a close eye on her surroundings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. Snorting excitedly, a heavy horse stands here. Frothing at the mouth and pacing about, a zombie kitten snarls at passers-by.  Soldier Vithincus Shu'in-Crescent is riding on a heavy horse. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems. A caparisoned charger stands nearby. There are 2 ebony pegasi here. A fuzzy brown bunny quietly nibbles a blade of grass. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Serenie, a little snow-white dove, lingers here with curiosity and joy. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A clouded leopard cub crouches nearby, keeping a close eye on her surroundings. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.
