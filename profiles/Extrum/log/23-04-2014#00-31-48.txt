A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A testament to his training, Ewig stands here as still as a mountain.  Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is here.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A testament to his training, Ewig stands here as still as a mountain.
You see exits leading north, west, and northwest.
