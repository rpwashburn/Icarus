Subject: Sartan Shrine Contest
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salutations Dawnspear,

Since the beginning of this Sartan shrine defiling contest, we have seen the dusted remains of nearly fifty Sartan shrines. This is a tremendous accomplishment, and the hard work of all those who have participated to make this happen has not gone unnoticed. Unfortunately, Mhaldor has been very diligent in their retaliations, and often when they do those who defiled are not willing to stick around to defend. This leaves a considerable weight on the shoulders of others to defend Their shrines, when those who actually defiled are nowhere to be found.

Though this is not true for all those who defiled, it is common enough that the shrine contest will be drawing to a close early at the end of this year, 652 after the fall of the Seleucarian Empire. If you defile without sticking around to aid in the defense that often follows, you will soon find yourself disqualified from the contest.

In service to the Bloodsworn and Their city,
Zuko Shu'in-Crescent, Monk of the Watch

Penned by my hand on the 4th of Valnuary, in the year 652 AF.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.
