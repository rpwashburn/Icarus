----[ Congregation House announcement ]----

Scholars of the Congregation, with the squabbles of the Conclave reaching out to all of Sapience, we should actively seek the best course of action that would serve Lord Sartan. Put simply, this boils down to a simple choice - supporting the red Dragon Yudhishthira or the ice wizard, Maklak. However, in order to decide what our course of action should be, we require information. Seek out everything that can be gathered from the past news, and from within our stores of information in the libraries of Mhaldor and the Congregation and succintly summarize the information into a letter to either myself, or Naga Jurixe. Your efforts will be recoginized in service towards the Lord.

Focus hard on aiding the young Malefics. They are our future and the Master requires competent new preachers of His will.

From   : Deaconess Saeva
To     : Halos Vorondil, Herald of Redemption
Subject: Herald of Rejection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings from the West.

Your address to the the one known as Tahquil Maris has left me in a state of amusement and satisfaction, though I pray you do misunderstand my own, Devout one. I do not admire your pending extension of forgiveness unto this one who has, in great wisdom known or unknown, turned her back on the Dawnspear. I needn't preach to you now of the Fourth Truth, and how forgiveness is yet a stepping stone in enabling weakness in those you wish to see flourish; it's a lesson you know well by now. I am pleased, though, to observe yet another example of hypocrisy spewing forth from the East.

?None are beyond forgiveness,? I believe you stated, though I might've misunderstood you from your precarious perch upon that supposedly higher road. If that is what you said, then you fail live up to your title, Herald of Redemption. You show the world that this 'grace' of forgiveness is only open to some, and denied to most, even those with whom you have served beside for an age. I have spent the the past decade watching Melodie LeMurzen, the fallen priestess of the Vashnars, fret and fuss to no avail in her attempts to earn forgiveness from the Bloodsworn and the citizenry of Targossas. She has not requested to command the power of Devotion again, but has simply been supplicating for this forgiveness you claim none are beyond, to be counted as an ally and not a foe to the Dawnspear. It would appear that it is too much to ask, to nobody's great surprise.

It pleases me, however, to see anyone, priestess or petitioner, fallen or not, enlightened to the filth that festers under the blinding disguise of Light, and for this, I offer you my gratitude. The words you yell down from your high road are distorted and unclear, and you echo this lack of forgiveness in your actions. You have given me hope that even you can one day see the error of your words and embrace the Truths of the Malevolent One, that one by one, all inhabitants of Sapience will see and acknowledge the very same hypocrisy that I see in the East, that we may be rid of the self-proclaimed protectors of Creation that are called Targossas.

Subject: The Reckoning
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It was frigid in the wizard's tower of ice, the perpetual state for the tundra, but his ambitions burned. Sick of waiting and watching, tired of the empty promises from the southern leader, 656AF was going to be his year to do something. That fat dragon cared only for wealth and buffalo, his glory days of work and experimentation now filled with blood and petty desires. More beast than genius, it was time for Yudhishthira to step aside. At least, these were the reasons Maklak gave me when I asked him later- that one always has had a flair for the dramatic.

It didn't take long before a chill breeze licked over Sapience, gusting from the northern expanses, banishing the warm tendrils of spring and carrying with it the challenge of the Ice Wizard.

"Yudhishthira," he cried, "You languish in that seat of power doing naught with the responsibility except fawning and admiring your scales."

For the first time in mortal ken, we, the Conclave, were to undertake a Reckoning, a period of trial to decide who will hold the position of leader of our notorious band of sages.

Somewhere in my library I kept the Rules of the Reckoning, signed by each of us centuries ago. I've dug it out, dusted away the detritus of time upon the shelf, and readied the record of allegiance that will tally the city and rogue declarations. I will note all who assist in the writing of this historic event.

                              ~~~

Esteemed members of the Conclave, the Rules of the Reckoning.

- Challengers have a period of twenty eight months in which to demonstrate their worthiness.

- The creatures of Sapience are to be their tools.

- Those who believe themselves outside the purview of the Reckoning will be given no quarter by any of the Conclave.

- Neither challenger will attack the other bodily whilst the Reckoning is underway, the Conclave does not brawl.

- All are bound by the result, there is no appeal.
