A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Stomping the ground occasionally, a huge armoured rhinoceros stands here. Resting here with a haughty expression is a golden gryphon. A giant tortoise sits here like a rock. Romping playfully around is an inquisitive bear cub. A chubby polar bear cub sniffs inquisitively at the air.

A frozen chamber beneath the barracks (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. An obsidian eye sigil is here. There are 4 metal tanks radiating waves of heat here. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Enran tends to his duties with studied concentration. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. The bloated length of a partially digested finger lies here. A metal tank stands here, dimly lit by a tiny spark within. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Niks is here. He wields a spiritual mace in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right.

A frozen chamber beneath the barracks (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Lying flat on the ground is a key-shaped sigil. An obsidian eye sigil is here. There are 4 metal tanks radiating waves of heat here. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Enran tends to his duties with studied concentration. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. The bloated length of a partially digested finger lies here. A metal tank stands here, dimly lit by a tiny spark within.
You see a single exit leading up (closed door).
