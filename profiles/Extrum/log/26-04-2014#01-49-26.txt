The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A small wooden lottery box stands here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Reonna is here. Kei Greywards is here. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is riding on an alabaster pegasus.

He is a human, possessed of a lanky figure and tall stature. Deep, blue eyes reveal an ever-present wariness that adds to his cautious and controlled bearing. Swept back across his head, a wave of dark hair crests his noble profile. Around his left ear, where the hair has been shaved to a reveal a dark tuft of scalp, a striking tattoo winds its inky way down his neck in a slash of deep colour. Thick, boldface letters are inked on the knuckles of either hand in heavy strokes of black. Complementary pinup style tattoos adorn the backs of each hand showing coquettish figures, one done in striking red and embellished with gold flakes, and the other a work of smooth curving lines and soft colours. He is wearing a blood ruby gold stud through his right ear, a blood ruby gold stud through his left ear, a small steel hoop accented by a ruby ball through his lower lip, a Mojushaine ring of the Striking Fist, a bone encrusted blackened steel hoop through his right nostril, a canvas backpack, a pair of black dragon-leather trousers, a comfortable light blue shirt, combat boots of titanium and black leather, a tarnished hoop of sinuously twisted silver through his septum, a pair of fire-forged knuckles, a bag of stasis, a Sempai's bronze linen robes, a suit of leather armour bearing the arms of Daslin, a hunter's belt, and a pair of Mayan Bracelets. He walks with the truefavour of Vastar.

A living puppet of Mithridates, its chest heaves a bit and its arms and legs move. Every detail of it is perfectly rendered, though the look in its eyes betrays no intelligence. It is a tool, not a fully living creature.
It has 7 months of usefulness left.
The puppet looks to have been fashioned approximately 68 times.
It weighs about 2 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Extrum.

Entering the main gate of Ashtan.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A thick stone slab stained with dried blood looms here, tainting the area with the profane worship of Babel. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A furry little humgii sits here, a hungry expression in his wide eyes. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. There are 2 Shadow Amazons here. A gleaming wooden sign is posted here. Polished marble gleaming, the Effigy of Victory resides here, a testament to the favour of the Great Mother. A sentry of the Vanguard maintains his vigil, a flame-blackened bardiche planted beside him. Casually sending electricity to dance between the fingers of her iron gauntlet, a smirking War Witch of Ashtan stands guard. Encased in gold-plated armour, a knight of the Illuminati stands motionless in silent vigil. The impressive black and gold city gates of Ashtan tower above you. There are 10 Masks of the Beast here.
