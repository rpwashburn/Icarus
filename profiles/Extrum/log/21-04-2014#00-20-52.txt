Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. Magnificent and terrible, a towering green wyvern surveys her surroundings with a haughty, serpentine glare. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is riding on an ebony pegasus. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand. The Green Dragon Carmell's imposing form looms. Sir Morthif Aristata, Knight of the Watch is here, faint silver scales shimmering over his form. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground.

A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the north. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. The soul of Aiseiri roams the land, bodiless. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the north. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.

A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the north. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the north. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.

There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A powerful black stallion stands here, ethereal blue flames rising from his body. Striking azure eyes staring lifelessly ahead, the corpse of a Tsol'dasi villager lies here. Spread-eagled in an absurd position, the corpse of a sword spider outrider lies here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. The soul of Nicia roams the land, bodiless.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself. Soldier Caladbolg Van Helsing is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands.

There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A powerful black stallion stands here, ethereal blue flames rising from his body. Striking azure eyes staring lifelessly ahead, the corpse of a Tsol'dasi villager lies here. Spread-eagled in an absurd position, the corpse of a sword spider outrider lies here.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground.  Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground.  Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a roughly-hewn crystalline staff in his left hand and a crystalline elemental shield in his right.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground.  Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Malefic Ignus, of Mhaldor is here, sprawled on the floor. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the up.  Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands. Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. The ground is slick with ice. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 war elephants here. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. Peering at the world with wide eyes is a tiny sugar glider. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A broken piece of a wickedly sharp, blackened blade has been discarded here. Lying hacked apart, the remains of a huge lycopod lie here. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A diminutive star-nosed mole pup wriggles his sensitive tentacles inquisitively at the ground. A fragile crystal spiderling skitters about. Preening its metal-edged feathers, an enormous Stymphalian bird glares about itself with beady, red eyes. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the up.  Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed. Sir Achilles, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is riding on a charcoal black hippogriff. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. Mithridates Eupator Dionysius is riding on a war elephant. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and up.

Oathsworn Ernam is here, calm and relaxed.
