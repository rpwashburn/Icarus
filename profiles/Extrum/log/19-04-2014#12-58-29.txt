The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

Problem:
Truenames hurt. They're not hard to get.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make truenames similar to puppets in that they decay when the owner of a truename kills the holder of the truename.
Solution #2:
Remove the decay time on truenames if solution 1 is deemed appropriate
Solution #3:
If neither of the above are deemed appropriate, add an anti truename aura. A ten second aura that prevents another name from hitting if the target was just truenamed by any source

Skill       : Woodlore       Ability     : Adrenaline
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
This is a suggestion regarding the speed of sentinel axes. At the current time, a sentinel with reflexes up and a decent speed axe can easily beat salve balance and keep someone permanently hindered with epseth/epteth. The idea for an active speed increase was suggested early in the class rework cycle, but was discarded in favor of the current chronic speed increase of handaxes that we have now. I propose a reversion of the chronic increase.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a new active ability called adrenaline, or something similar. This ability would function much like chivalry fury in that it could be activated for x time per hour and this timer would reset every Achaean day
Solution #2:
Rescale current chronically active handaxe speeds.

Skill       : Metamorphosis  Ability     : Trumpet
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Trumpet can currently be spammed on a single target at the cost of one sub second handaxe from a sentinel. Even if the target is currently concentrating from the previous trumpet, a subsequent trumpet will redisrupt and cancel the concentration. This leads to a case of a permanently proned and disrupted target.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Disallow the overlapping of trumpet disrupts much like current entangles are coded. If you're writhing, a further entangle of the same class doesn't reset the writhe timer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The newest feature of truenames, specifically their decay time, seems a bit much considering how much the ability has been modified since it was first introduced. The fast decay time makes the total limit completely irrelevant. Yes, truenames are not the hardest to get but when multiple Occultists are around, many of those names go to one or two people and others receive no benefit or they receive truenames for people who are not around much and will just decay before they can be used
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
In conjuction with classlead 22, remove the decay property of truenames.
Solution #2:
Remove the decay timer of truenames but reduce the maximum number allowed to compensate.

Skill       : Groves         Ability     : Portability
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
With the use of grove conceal and the portability of groves, a group with a Groves user maintains complete control of fight initiation. When you can't know where they're setup, the only options for initiation involve wandering around looking for the Grove, opening yourself up to instant-gate and attack (you cannot keep up monolith and movement at the same time, gate will eventually beat you), or tracking directly into the grove and an unknown number of defenders and room effects.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a 1 hour cooldown to Grove Portability. This means that you can have a single person track and find the location, and know that the location cannot change for a period of time. Knowing the location of the grove still leaves a large number of benefits for the grove, but gives a reliable form of approach for the opposing group

Problem:
Currently artefact bows offer extremely high damage-per-time combined with a high rate of affliction from LoS, which has effectively no risk
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Add a new artefact option for Line of Sight attacks, crossbows. Reduce the damage of bows to half their current amount, implement crossbows at a slightly slower speed but their damage should be the same as current bows, and crossbows bolts don't deliver venoms, but still deal poison damage type to make them not highly mitigated

Skill       : Evileye        Ability     : Deadeyes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Apostate combat centers around evil eye. In order to use evil eye, the Apostate must be unblind. This makes them particularly susceptible to transfix from elementalists and sentinels, more so than other classes. Under the present system and upon encountering a transfixer, the Apostate may either forgo use of evil eye, or may use a complex system of eatting bayberry/arsenic following every stare (consuming herb balance for the entire fight as herb balance is similar to deadeyes balance), and become unblind just prior to each stare via SIGHT (delayed) or epidermal (immediate, consumes salve balance for roughly half of the fight).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Bring Apostates on par with other classes by allowing them to use deadeyes/stare while blind, provided that mindseye is active. No additional cost.
Solution #2:
Similar to Solution #1: Provide Apostates with a defense that, for a moderate to high sustained cost to mana/willpower, allows them to stare so long as mindseye is active.
Solution #3:
Provide Apostates with the ability to become blind immediately for a moderate one-time cost to mana/willpower. Ability would be able to be used while off balance, but would have a balance of its own so as not to be abused. Allow SIGHT to be instant use without channel time.

Achaea is currently seeing a trend where adventurers are becoming greater dragons at the age as young as 30. I believe the causes are elite membership and free and abundant hunting bonuses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Reduce the amount of experience gained from hunting and PK across all boards. From what I understand, dragon talismans and gold drops were reduced because it was "possible" to achieve certain extremes. I believe an experience gain reduction would suffice.
Solution #2:
I strongly believe the experience loss from death in Achaea has been "dumbed down" far too much. Introduce a flat 10% experience loss at all levels upon death. I realize this would hit the high level adventurers more than the low level adventurers.

Problem:
Currently Apostate's are unfairly matched against Elementalism-users and Sentinels because of Deadeyes requiring unblind to use while being integral to the Apostate offense, and transfix being available to both of the above classes on-demand and passively, respectively. With transfix having such a long writhe time, this is an imbalance against the Apostate.

Skill       : Apostasy       Ability     : Hunt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hunt is an important part of an Aposate's offense in delivering a vital lock component - slickness. Correct curing priorities and appropriate defensive action make it hard for an Apostate to actually lock an opponent. Touch shield completely stops Hunt, Nightmare afflicts randomly and unseen to the Apostate, and Stain can be managed by using tree, any active class curing and fitness if available to diminish the effectiveness of a necessary kelp stack. Due to their variety of killing methods, but overall lack of efficiency at achieving them alone, they make for great allies in group combat yet noticeably lacking offensively in duels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make the initiation message of Hunt hidden if Night is present in the room. However, if the target is afflicted with demon stain then they are still able to see the initiation message due to being sufficiently attuned to the energies of Apostasy. The Daegger will also not stop hunting unless the target is shielded when it actually attempts to hit them, allowing the Apostate the opportunity to try and remove the target's shield.
Solution #2:
Add an imposable delay on when the Daegger first attempts to attack the target. Such as 'DAEGGER HUNT TECTON 6' up to a maximum of 10. If no time is specified, Hunt would work like it typically does. However, if the delay is used, a drawback could be that the venom only has a 50% chance to actually afflict the target - this idea is a bit strong otherwise. To clarify, the initiation of the Hunt message with this solution would not be hidden under the effect of Night.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Damnation is incredibly difficult to achieve now. To hinder a person long enough to secure that they stay in the room long enough to stick asthma, hellsight and a broken head, you need to either double break their legs before head, which opens up an entirely new can of worms in sacrificing herb venoms needed in order to stick asthma by having to use delphinium/delphinium, and by taking the time to bypass parry - in which they could attempt to just go for a disembowel instead. This problem stems from the fact that a broken head is incredibly easy to spot and respond to by shielding. For the Knight to stick enough afflictions to kelp stack within rebounding and still break head before rebounding returns, and then hellsight and Damn the target - they need to have very fast rapiers and rely on their target not behaving defensively at all with a well-timed shield, or hangedman, or web, or paralysis or clumsiness, etc. to disrupt their execution of Damnation. An unreasonable expectation in making Damnation viable only on the incredibly unware.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
place an ability in Devotion called 'Condemn'. The ability would surround and affect the target for sixty seconds, and initiation of the ability would cost a large amount of Devotion, and/or mana, and/or willpower (to be decided by the powers that be). Condemn would make restoration take six seconds to cure limb breaks, rathern than four. Restoration applied while Condemned but not limb broken would send you off salve-balance for two seconds. This is to counter act Bard minuet, tremolo and Condemn. This may seem initially powerful, but if we think about it, it achieves a number of things while retaining its counter-measures: It gives Paladin's a more efficient, and easier time in bypassing parry with a single, or double arm break. It makes it more viable for a Paladin to stick asthma and addiction off double arm breaks. It allows a Paladin to keep a target prone for longer, while being able to stick a broken head for long enough to stick a kelp stack over arm breaks in order to stick hellsight and damnation. It makes doubleslashing with slike to stick anorexia while the target is off salve balance more efficient. It does not make disembowel significantly more potent, because Paladin's are not doubleslashing any faster as they do not have runeblades or a frenzy-esque ability. Tumble times will remain the same, and tumble will remain just as effective an avoidance tactic versus disembowel.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Soldier Iskla Rian is here, almost bouncing with excitement. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

6655h, 4760m, 30091e, 21685w cexkdb-
The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Soldier Iskla Rian is here, almost bouncing with excitement. Oathsworn Shiro is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. There are 3 throwing axes here. A steel-plated chair is here. Oathsworn Shiro is here. Soldier Iskla Rian is here, almost bouncing with excitement. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood.

He is a human of slight build, standing at five feet, ten inches tall with a lithe and lightly muscled frame. His striking peridot-green eyes gaze impassionately upon his surroundings, sharply contrasting his severe, slightly gaunt and profoundly furrowed features, complete with a pale, almost ashen complexion. His short-cut hair bears a mottled black hue, interspersed with prominent lines of aging grey, and is cropped roughly around his eyes, affording him a clear line of sight at all times. The entire portion of his upper left arm is covered with a series of whitened scars that span across his skin like webwork, with three large gouges within the center running the width of his arm. Tiny white speckles run across the scar's surface, curiously visible amongst the mass of gnarled, recently healed skin. He is wearing a fire pendant, a dragonskin pack, a studded leather baldric, a long-sleeved ashen grey leather coat, a grey linen duelist's shirt, a slender wrist sheath of black and gold, a mottled taenite and platinum scabbard, a fluvial silver belthook, an ornate ivory scabbard, a Mayan ring, a signet ring bearing the arms of Daeir, a plain gold ring, 2 shiny steel rings, a silver ring of meditation, a pair of full-length dark grey trousers, a pair of steel-buckled black leather boots, a polished glass scroll case, a simple silver necklace, and a suit of scale mail.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

He is a human of slight build, standing at five feet, ten inches tall with a lithe and lightly muscled frame. His striking peridot-green eyes gaze impassionately upon his surroundings, sharply contrasting his severe, slightly gaunt and profoundly furrowed features, complete with a pale, almost ashen complexion. His short-cut hair bears a mottled black hue, interspersed with prominent lines of aging grey, and is cropped roughly around his eyes, affording him a clear line of sight at all times. The entire portion of his upper left arm is covered with a series of whitened scars that span across his skin like webwork, with three large gouges within the center running the width of his arm. Tiny white speckles run across the scar's surface, curiously visible amongst the mass of gnarled, recently healed skin. He is wearing a fire pendant, a dragonskin pack, a studded leather baldric, a long-sleeved ashen grey leather coat, a grey linen duelist's shirt, a slender wrist sheath of black and gold, a mottled taenite and platinum scabbard, a fluvial silver belthook, an ornate ivory scabbard, a Mayan ring, a signet ring bearing the arms of Daeir, a plain gold ring, 2 shiny steel rings, a silver ring of meditation, a pair of full-length dark grey trousers, a pair of steel-buckled black leather boots, a polished glass scroll case, a simple silver necklace, and a suit of scale mail.

He is a human of slight build, standing at five feet, ten inches tall with a lithe and lightly muscled frame. His striking peridot-green eyes gaze impassionately upon his surroundings, sharply contrasting his severe, slightly gaunt and profoundly furrowed features, complete with a pale, almost ashen complexion. His short-cut hair bears a mottled black hue, interspersed with prominent lines of aging grey, and is cropped roughly around his eyes, affording him a clear line of sight at all times. The entire portion of his upper left arm is covered with a series of whitened scars that span across his skin like webwork, with three large gouges within the center running the width of his arm. Tiny white speckles run across the scar's surface, curiously visible amongst the mass of gnarled, recently healed skin. He is wearing a fire pendant, a dragonskin pack, a studded leather baldric, a long-sleeved ashen grey leather coat, a grey linen duelist's shirt, a slender wrist sheath of black and gold, a mottled taenite and platinum scabbard, a fluvial silver belthook, an ornate ivory scabbard, a Mayan ring, a signet ring bearing the arms of Daeir, a plain gold ring, 2 shiny steel rings, a silver ring of meditation, a pair of full-length dark grey trousers, a pair of steel-buckled black leather boots, a polished glass scroll case, a simple silver necklace, and a suit of scale mail.

He is a human of slight build, standing at five feet, ten inches tall with a lithe and lightly muscled frame. His striking peridot-green eyes gaze impassionately upon his surroundings, sharply contrasting his severe, slightly gaunt and profoundly furrowed features, complete with a pale, almost ashen complexion. His short-cut hair bears a mottled black hue, interspersed with prominent lines of aging grey, and is cropped roughly around his eyes, affording him a clear line of sight at all times. The entire portion of his upper left arm is covered with a series of whitened scars that span across his skin like webwork, with three large gouges within the center running the width of his arm. Tiny white speckles run across the scar's surface, curiously visible amongst the mass of gnarled, recently healed skin. He is wearing a fire pendant, a dragonskin pack, a studded leather baldric, a long-sleeved ashen grey leather coat, a grey linen duelist's shirt, a slender wrist sheath of black and gold, a mottled taenite and platinum scabbard, a fluvial silver belthook, an ornate ivory scabbard, a Mayan ring, a signet ring bearing the arms of Daeir, a plain gold ring, 2 shiny steel rings, a silver ring of meditation, a pair of full-length dark grey trousers, a pair of steel-buckled black leather boots, a polished glass scroll case, a simple silver necklace, and a suit of scale mail.

An almost unbearable feeling of emptiness heralds the arrival of a cloaked and hooded figure carrying a blood-stained sickle. Daeir gasps in terror as a skeletal hand emerges from the sleeve and points at him. He bows his head to the inevitable as the manifestation of Death swings its sickle at his neck. You watch in fascinated horror as he is gathered to Death's cold bosom.

Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A steel-plated chair is here. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here.

Before the eastern stairs (indoors).
Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A small spinning crystal sphere floats here. A dark spinning crystal spiral is here, floating. A spinning pentagon carved from a cloudy white crystal floats here. Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. A fiery efreeti spins madly here.  Terra a'Bertal is here. She wields an elemental staff in her left hand and an ornate steel rapier in her right.

4542h, 4303m, 29995e, 17657w cekdb-
Your somersault takes you out of the room.
Circling the main ring (road).
A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground.

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. A sleek pony grazes nearby. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A noble hippogriff flaps its wings in agitation here. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare. A small forest of sharpened crystals protrudes from the ground.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

Rally point.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. There are 2 rugged war goats here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. Weaving in an infinite loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged, icy serpent eyes her surroundings with a cold stare.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

The Plaza of the Faithful.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A weary soldier watches the world with tired eyes. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Luminous shadows coalesce in fiery splendour around the golden Pyre of the Faithful. An heraldic pennon flies here, bearing the city arms of Targossas. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring.
You see exits leading north, east, and west.

Skill       : Evileye        Ability     : Deadeyes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Apostate combat centers around evil eye. In order to use evil eye, the Apostate must be unblind. This makes them particularly susceptible to transfix from elementalists and sentinels, more so than other classes. Under the present system and upon encountering a transfixer, the Apostate may either forgo use of evil eye, or may use a complex system of eatting bayberry/arsenic following every stare (consuming herb balance for the entire fight as herb balance is similar to deadeyes balance), and become unblind just prior to each stare via SIGHT (delayed) or epidermal (immediate, consumes salve balance for roughly half of the fight).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Bring Apostates on par with other classes by allowing them to use deadeyes/stare while blind, provided that mindseye is active. No additional cost.
Solution #2:
Similar to Solution #1: Provide Apostates with a defense that, for a moderate to high sustained cost to mana/willpower, allows them to stare so long as mindseye is active.
Solution #3:
Provide Apostates with the ability to become blind immediately for a moderate one-time cost to mana/willpower. Ability would be able to be used while off balance, but would have a balance of its own so as not to be abused. Allow SIGHT to be instant use without channel time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Currently Apostate's are unfairly matched against Elementalism-users and Sentinels because of Deadeyes requiring unblind to use while being integral to the Apostate offense, and transfix being available to both of the above classes on-demand and passively, respectively. With transfix having such a long writhe time, this is an imbalance against the Apostate. However transfix does remain a suitable counter for a small set of classes, so making Apostate's impervious to the ability seems counter-intuitive.

Skill       : Apostasy       Ability     : Hunt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Hunt is an important part of an Aposate's offense in delivering a vital lock component - slickness. Correct curing priorities and appropriate defensive action make it hard for an Apostate to actually lock an opponent. Touch shield completely stops Hunt, Nightmare afflicts randomly and unseen to the Apostate, and Stain can be managed by using tree, any active class curing and fitness if available to diminish the effectiveness of a necessary kelp stack. Due to their variety of killing methods, but overall lack of efficiency at achieving them alone, they make for great allies in group combat yet noticeably lacking offensively in duels.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make the initiation message of Hunt hidden if Night is present in the room. However, if the target is afflicted with demon stain then they are still able to see the initiation message due to being sufficiently attuned to the energies of Apostasy. The Daegger will also not stop hunting unless the target is shielded when it actually attempts to hit them, allowing the Apostate the opportunity to try and remove the target's shield.
Solution #2:
Add an imposable delay on when the Daegger first attempts to attack the target. Such as 'DAEGGER HUNT TECTON 6' up to a maximum of 10. If no time is specified, Hunt would work like it typically does. However, if the delay is used, a drawback could be that the venom only has a 50% chance to actually afflict the target - this idea is a bit strong otherwise. To clarify, the initiation of the Hunt message with this solution would not be hidden under the effect of Night.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Damnation is incredibly difficult to achieve now. To hinder a person long enough to secure that they stay in the room long enough to stick asthma, hellsight and a broken head, you need to either double break their legs before head, which opens up an entirely new can of worms in sacrificing herb venoms needed in order to stick asthma by having to use delphinium/delphinium, and by taking the time to bypass parry - in which they could attempt to just go for a disembowel instead. This problem stems from the fact that a broken head is incredibly easy to spot and respond to by shielding. For the Knight to stick enough afflictions to kelp stack within rebounding and still break head before rebounding returns, and then hellsight and Damn the target - they need to have very fast rapiers and rely on their target not behaving defensively at all with a well-timed shield, or hangedman, or web, or paralysis or clumsiness, etc. to disrupt their execution of Damnation. An unreasonable expectation in making Damnation viable only on the incredibly unware.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
place an ability in Devotion called 'Condemn'. The ability would surround and affect the target for sixty seconds, and initiation of the ability would cost a large amount of Devotion, and/or mana, and/or willpower (to be decided by the powers that be). Condemn would make restoration take six seconds to cure limb breaks, rathern than four. Restoration applied while Condemned but not limb broken would send you off salve-balance for two seconds. This is to counter act Bard minuet, tremolo and Condemn. This may seem initially powerful, but if we think about it, it achieves a number of things while retaining its counter-measures: It gives Paladin's a more efficient, and easier time in bypassing parry with a single, or double arm break. It makes it more viable for a Paladin to stick asthma and addiction off double arm breaks. It allows a Paladin to keep a target prone for longer, while being able to stick a broken head for long enough to stick a kelp stack over arm breaks in order to stick hellsight and damnation. It makes doubleslashing with slike to stick anorexia while the target is off salve balance more efficient. It does not make disembowel significantly more potent, because Paladin's are not doubleslashing any faster as they do not have runeblades or a frenzy-esque ability. Tumble times will remain the same, and tumble will remain just as effective an avoidance tactic versus disembowel.

Blademasters, as a limb damage class are not needing of an ability that bypasses all room hindrance. It is entirely obnoxious not to be able to hold down a Blademaster for any fixed length of time without prior setup i.e. our own limb breaks. and they can essentially escape from any momentum other classes can inflict while retaining all of their own setup. This places them in a position of ultimate superiority against momentum classes and significantly above other prep classes of which require some prior momentum in "pre-damage" to really have a chance at killing them (see: disembowel, freeze pound, and so on).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove Evade from Shindo and replace it with the Balancing ability available to Jesters and Bards in Pranks and Swashbuckling, respectively.
Solution #2:
Replace Evade with a passive ability called 'Agility' that hides the third person message for LEAP exit and entrance, and allows the Blademaster to avoid any totems they are enemied to in the room, implanted or propped, as well as ground runes. Leap will still function as normal, and hit any room hindrance on the way out but still bypass icewalls and rubble.
Solution #3:
A combination of the above. Replace the ability of Evade with Balancing, and add 'Agility' to Shindo. Lastly, consider making Leap not have a hidden enter and exit message but keep everything else I proposed.

Skill       : Hypnosis       Ability     : Hypnotise
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Most serpents use very, very little of the hypnosis skillset, as most of it is useless in almost every conceivable situation.  After playing serpent for over 10 years, I can say with confidence that many of the afflictions have no use whatsoever, while many of the others are only used very, very rarely.  Many serpents only use four abilities in the entire skillset (impatience, confusion, disrupt, and action).  Another problem with hypnosis is that many of the would-be useful afflictions do not have a third-person message, allowing the serpent to see when their suggestion lands (while the target DOES).  Combined with the slow speed and random nature of hypnosis, invisible afflictions are almost entirely useless to a class that requires near-perfect timing to defeat anyone with either high-end curing system, life-vision, or passive healing (or all three).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Complete overhaul of the Hypnosis skillset.  The concept of the randomly timed afflictions predates curing systems entirely, and is no longer actually reliable enough for use in any level of combat.
Solution #2:
Two-part adjustment to how hypnosis works.  1) Add third-person affliction messages to all hypnosis afflictions -OR- remove the randomness from hypnosis entirely.  It is not so powerful that it needs to be made unreliable.  In combination with either of these options, lower the limit of suggestions to 6 to counter the perceived "upgrade" to hypnosis.
Solution #3:
Add a new defense for serpents (or add functionality to an existing Vision ability) to allow a serpent to see when their hypnosis afflictions land, for an endurance drain.

Skill       : Vision         Ability     : Hypersight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Two Problems: 1) Hypersight has virtually no practical uses.  2) Passive healing has no third-person message in the room to show when activated(with the exception of Dagaz rune).  Hidden passives make it nearly impossible for affliction classes to win in fights, particularly against the randomly timed passives (angel care, rite of healing, etc.).  The recent change to voyria did -not- solve this problem as intended, as it dramatically slows offense repeatedly having to afflict with voyria, and is 100% counterable by simply sipping immunity, which is balanceless, periodically.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Give passive healing a third-person message to everyone in the room who isn't blind.
Solution #2:
Add the ability to see when passives occur to Hypersight, making it useful and helping affliction classes know when things are disappearing.
Solution #3:
Give passive healing a third-person message, and add functionality to Hypersight to let a player see -which- affliction was cured.

Skill       : Crystalism     Ability     : Retardation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
While critically important in solo combat, magi retardation is far too powerful when used with a group, against either an individual or in group vs. group fights.  Almost every time retardation is used in a raid, for example, that group is almost always entirely wiped out.  This is too powerful for a single ability that requires nothing but 2 seconds of balance, that doesn't even require the presence of the user.  The normal argument against changes to retardation is that it is balanced, as it is a "double edged-sword".  However, as anyone who has experience with raids is well aware of, it is never actually used in a situation that imposes risk on the user or their group.  It's use in group scenarios almost always involves some form of room hindrance (frozen ground, piety, gravehands, walls) to block a group in, while those in the retardation vibe are attacked from outside of it, with area and projectile attacks.  Nothing else in the game even comes close to being able to destroy an entire group of people without even being present.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Those in the room with a retardation vibe should not be able to be hit by projectile attacks by anyone but the owner of the vibe itself.  This leaves solo magi combat completely unaffected, but solves the problem quite well.
Solution #2:
Make magi retardation affect a single target, instead of everyone in the room.  This also does not affect solo magi combat, but fixes the problem.  Syntax: EMBED RETARDATION FOR <player>
Solution #3:
Implement a 2 second tic when retardation is in a room.  Every two seconds, everyone in the room who has the speed defense will have their speed defense stripped, akin to Aeon.  On the next tic, without speed, retardation would begin functioning as normal.  This solution removes the "surprise attack" retardation tactic consisting of leaving retardation/room hindrance in people's walking routes, and using a bow/throwing to sleep-lock them, while out of combat.   This also gives people a small window of escape before retardation lands, if their speed defense is up.  It would also allow a 2 second burst of not being in retardation if they re-def speed inside of retardation (which wouldn't actually be practicle, but would be possible).  This -is- a mild "nerf" to retardation, however, and should be paired with some form of upgrade to Magi that doesn't involve leaning solely on retardation to win either solo or group fights.

Skill       : Subterfuge     Ability     : Lightwall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The change to subterfuge lightwall (its interaction with darkshade ) was a big improvement to serpent combat in general, as it forced people to choose between curing darkshade or other kill methods, instead of simply prioritizing impatience and asthma at all times.  However, as more and more players learn about how this works, the more I see people simply refusing to fight in the relatively uncommon scenario that is required for the lightwall change to actually affect combat:  Outdoors, during daytime, in a room with a lightwall present.  It is far too easy to simply move indoors, or leave the room with the lightwall in it.  Also, I think most serpents resent the fact that the time of day dramatically influences fighting strategy.  Some also resent the fact that a class built on subterfuge is actually much better off fighting outdoors in daylight than in darkness.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Lightwalls are very bright.  Let their existence in a room negate the need for sunlight entirely (while darkshade without the presence of a lightwall will still require sunlight).
Solution #2:
Create and sell an artefact (would be a good SoW item) that allows one to create "sunlight" in a room for a period of time.  This would have uses to several classes, not just serpent.   The only problem with this is is that it would require casting a lightwall, -and- casting sunlight in every room, for darkshade to be useful.  This does not synergize with the highly mobile design of the serpent class.
Solution #3:
Create a new serpent defense that creates sunlight in the room they are present in.  This would create light, as well as be visible in a player's short and long descriptions.  I would recommend a somewhere between a 5 and 15 minute duration, at which point it would have to be re-cast, akin to Shroud.  While active, a serpent cannot be hidden. (Hide drops the sunlight defense, and casting the sunlight defense drops hiding.).  This would allow serpents to use darkshade in indoor/night-time environments, at the cost of the benefits of being hidden (which includes the ability to use BACKSTAB).

Skill       : Tattoos        Ability     : Shield
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Shield tattoo does not show when it is dropped (like rebounding).  This makes it very difficult to keep track of when someone is shielded or not.  It -can- be done, but only by triggering literally every aggressive third-party room message in the game.  Not only is this very complicated and time-intensive for new players, but it is also unnecssarily cumbersome on many game clients.  Additionally, from an in-character perspective, it doesn't make sense that I can easily see when a bright spheric shield appears around someone, but I can't see when it instantly disappears.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Create a third person (room) message for shield dropping, akin to rebounding.  If someone performs an aggressive action with both shield and rebounding defenses, show that they are both dropped together (vice two separate lines) to minimize "spam".  Movement should show shield droppin in the originating room only.
Solution #2:
same as solution 1, but shield disappearance isn't seen if "true blind".

Skill       :                Ability     : Necrolysation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
In the current climate, due to evolving systems and combat logic amongst people becoming more efficient, infernals are lacking a way of capitalising on their setups. They lack a shieldbreaker to prevent people avoiding disembowel, and restoring and not applying restoration while off equilibrium has been shown to be a successful method of avoiding vivisect, especially since restore was reduced to only partially take into account partially damaged/mangled limbs, so that cleave was taken out of the equation. If logs are required to prove this, they can be provided.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Necrolysation could be an ability to add a 50% fail rate to restore. So if someone uses restore while necrolysed, there is a 50% chance for each individual limb to be cured. For each limb not cured, the equilibrium cost will be reduced as if that limb was not broken. This will lessen reliance on a trigger to restore on limb breaks. To make it effective, the ability should be delayed. Once activated, the infernal will lose equilibrium and be unable to do anything for 2 seconds, at the end of the 2 seconds, he regains equilibrium and it will inflict the target, as well as give a message. The cure should either be a ten second wear off, or applying to torso so that the ability retains it's usefulness. It would cost a hefty amount of essence, around 10%
Solution #2:
increase the equilibrium cost of restore to it's previous state.
Solution #3:
If the head is damaged, restore has a chance to fail entirely.  This will add an extra defensive dimension when fighting infernals, and people will have to be more wary of how they are defending.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Vigour was understandably nerfed in recent times as it added a lot of health that was difficult to overcome. During this time, offensive abilities were generally buffed, and infernals do not have the tankiness that the other Knight classes are afforded. Putrefaction struggles to make up for it as it provides a similar or less defense to toughness and algiz, but at the cost of a health drain.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Either buff the defense given by putrefaction or remove the health drain. (or both). I feel these things were implemented as "flavour" and do not add much balance wise. I would prefer buffing the defense, to retain the "flavour" that it hurts us.
Solution #2:
remove vigour being stopped by broken arms, as I feel arms are targetted as a priority in anycase to prevent restoration to legs, so vigour became useless overnight when this change was made. Vigour should be prevented by something else, perhaps torso break, (Your body is too damaged for you to cast this), as it would allow the infernal or apostate to think about how to heal themselves more dynamically without sacrificing their life in the process.

Skill       : Runelore       Ability     : New
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
With recent changes to Thurisaz versus flooded rooms - it is quite a poorly working solution.  As it stands, the ability of flooding can completely mitigate the offensive and defensive abilities within Runelore. Flooding isn't simply restricted to one class, either, as the artefact, 'Sceptre of Aqueous Mastery' was sold that allowed this. Once a room is flooded, there is virtually zero way to remove the water as the artefact is no longer offerered and, frankly, shouldn't be mandatory for fair combat as a Runewarden. Having a Thurisaz rune sketched leaves the room unable to be flooded for a very short length of time, but it doesn't counter the ability. It's merely a very short-lived prevention for a singular room against an ability which prevents propping totems, sketching of any sort, or any out of room attacks (Thurisaz, Othala) from working once present. Once the room is flooded, there is zero remedy for the Runelorist side from simply not being anywhere near said room, often times leaving an entire skillset unusable by one simple ability which was offered in an artefact.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
A new rune that can be sketched into water that dispels water / serves as a ward against flooding for the tenure of the sketch. This is a perfect balance as it strips the ability to put down a second offensive / defensive rune at the cost of one effectively being present to prevent flooding.
Solution #2:
Allow Othala to be sketched in a flooded room, evaporating off the water only after the Othala has ran its course and faded, and preventing re-flooding for a short time in the sketched room plus all adjacent rooms.
Solution #3:
Allow Hugalaz to be sketched in a flooded room with a moderately increased sketch time, freezing the flooded water and creating a room covered in ice in its place.

Skill       : Metamorphosis  Ability     : Bind
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The balance time on Hydra Bind is crazy long. 12s. This makes it basically useable once, maybe twice per conflict before you lose interest in using it again. While it is nice that you can still move around with the third head recovering balance, it does severely limit your survivability if you choose to use it at all, since you can't morph again until your heads come back and a lot of surivival means in Metamorphosis require morphing (ie burrowing, flying, sing melody)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Half the head recovery time on Hydra Bind. 6s I think is fair considering the fact that it gets around buckawns. This gives the target time to writhe off and then flee if they wish to avoid getting getting bound again.
Solution #2:
decrease the heads balance recovery to 3 seconds, but introduce a cooldown on the bind ability. 6 seconds should be a fair cooldown.

This is not a problem for classes with Force abilities but those without have to rely on afflictions like fear or shyness to get a chance at stopping the tumble. This is a valid tactic but is slightly hampered by the fact that the affliction does not give a 3rd person message when it cancels a tumble, essentially giving anyone with the foresight to try to use these afflictions as a counter no chance to capitalize on their preparation.

Hydra is currently a slow-hitting versatile morph that differentiates the druid from the sentinels fast paced fighting. Currently it has mechanisms for freezing, hindering, afflicting and doing damage. In this classlead I want to take up the damage hydra morph can do. It's damage combo is currently rather slow (3 seconds), and hardly does any damage. Statistics are not very effective since only one of the head abilities is buffed by int (flame) and on the same head you can use bite which is slightly affected by str. These damage abilities needs to be revisited, their scaling needs to adjusted and artifacts should be worth investing in to boost them.

Hydra Snap (2'nd head) doesn't seem to be affected by statistics, introduce strength scaling.

Skill       : Crystalism     Ability     : Cataclysm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
With the recent change to Cataclysm to only work within a 3 room radius, the skill has been severely reduced in terms of usefulness.  To still require the presence of 3 transcendant magi to begin using the transcendant skill of the set seems a bit punitive at this point.  For an area wide ability that allowed the casting of several skills it definitely fit in terms of difficulty to begin.  However, now that balance has been lost and needs to be reviewed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Leave the current situation with where cataclysm works in place, but reduce the number of magi needed to spin it to only 2.  This stops the possible use of it in one versus one situations in conjunction with retardation, if only a single magi was needed to spin it.
Solution #2:
Allow cataclysm to be used indoors and still require 3 magi to activate.  Given the restriction on meteors indoors, shielding would still keep this from being overpowering, while allowing a transcendant skill to be worthy of the position in the skill set.
Solution #3:
A combination of 1-2 above.  Two magi would be needed to use cataclysm outdoors, while adding a third imbuer would allow it to be used indoors.  All other restrictions remain the same.

Currently it has mechanisms for freezing, hindering, afflicting and doing damage. In this classlead I want to take up the versatility of the metamorph. Many of the 3'rd head abilities of the hydra are slow, if you use them you are stuck in hydra even if the benefit of the head is often minor.

Skill       : Devotion       Ability     : Hellsight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Due to the random nature of the afflictions hellsight gives it's often not useful until an opponent is already in a position where they're incapable of curing it.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the Paladin or Priest to specify an affliction to be instantly given when using hellsight, with the syntax PERFORM HELLSIGHT <target> <affliction>.

Problem:
Chaoscalm is difficult to use against entities when there are multiple of the same type in the room.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:

Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : Fashions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
I feel like fashioning should do something more to help to defend the shaman just a tiny bit when fashioning and can be useful in raids, if used properly, as well as other strategies specifically with bleeding and possibly even inflame.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Have fashioning drain a tiny bit of man from the target with each fashion and maybe twice the amount when you get a truefashion. Alternatively, instead of mana it could possibly have some other draining effect such as willpower, endurance, health, or a minor bleed. I feel this could differ Vodun from Puppetry just a bit and show the "mystical" side of Vodun and it's link to the persons "life essence"
Solution #2:
Have fashioning like normal up to a certain point and than drain mana or have some other minor effect on the target based on the amount of fashions you have acquired. I feel this could give fashioning a "dangerous" feel and can offer some warning to the target of how far into fashioning they are as well as showing the mystical side of vodun.
Solution #3:
Have fashioning remain the same as it is now because we all know it is still awesome either way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Penitence, a skill to give devotion back to the Priest if they land the kill on a person isn't entirely useful and as far as I can see haven't been in much use. The skill encourages killstealing, which is a silly idea, and it's not really a Priests job to killsteal - they have rites and support to be taking care of. It costs 1.8s eq and requires both balance and equilibrium.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Randomness is terrible, and infusions use randomness to make us all suffer.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Double the cost of infusions, and make it so that they last across two slashes, applying the respective affliction only on one of the two slashes (either fixed as the first or the second).
Solution #2:
As #1, but let the blademaster pick which slash applies the affliction when initially infusing, allowing blademasters to string two infusion afflictions in a row if so desired (ie. infuse1, INFUSE1, INFUSE2, infuse2, where capitals means applied affliction).
Solution #3:
Some crazy Two Arts faux venom system, where after doing X slashes with a particular infusion, you gain a charge added to your blade that can later be used to afflict, able to store up to, I dunno, three or four charges, depending on how they're activated. Could be activated per slash or just activated until you run out. Could be activated in parallel to infusions (letting you rack up more afflictions as you go), or using them could be an infusion itself.

Problem:
It is simply too easy to cancel a large number of warps with essentially no cost to yourself. It takes just as long to cancel a wormhole as a it takes two people to splice a wormhole. So essentially the aggressor, or the person canceling, has it easier

Solution #1:
Make it such that canceling requires 2 people. One on either side of the wormhole or require 3 people on one side of a worm hole, such that wormholes which lead to rooms with guards can eventually be canceled. Also add a function which notifies serpents of wormholes being canceled.
Solution #2:

Skill       : Shindo         Ability     : Annihilation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The roomwide shin effects (annihilation/blizzard/thunderstorm) are meant to lend group combat utility to a 1v1-centric class. The problem lies in the fact that these effects do not warrant costing almost a third of a BM's total shin. They don't reliably do enough damage compared to other room effects (like holocaust/hailstorm/etc) and neither do they reliably afflict (compared to deep freeze/tailsweep/etc). The value of group-centric moves is partly based on such reliability. This report seeks to amend this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Increase the base damage of shin annihilation/blizzard/thunderstorm in exchange for lowering the proc rate of the extra effects like pushing people out, epilepsy, etc.
Solution #2:
Increase the proc rate (80%+?) of the extra effects like pushing people out, epilepsy, etc. in exchange for downgrading the base damage of annihilation/blizzard/thunderstorm.
Solution #3:
Introduce a single target version of all these moves that will always proc the extra affliction on top of more damage.

Problem:
Cataclysm has lost its power greatly with recent changes and, especially with the three magi limit still in place, is not worthy of being a transcendant skill in the eyes of many. Its utility and power are third-rate because of this, as it is rare that three magi will be around to spin this vibe, wasting valuable crystals for little benefit.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow Cataclysm to be spun by one Magi and to work indoors. This vibe will only allow a 1 room radius for spellcasting, allowing a single mage to have adjacent room damaging for 1v1. The caveat is this: for every magi that imbues and -is present- in the room with the vibration, the radius will extend an additional room (3 rooms for 3 imbuers, 7 rooms for 7, etc). This makes it so that there is incentive for other magi to utilize this vibration, bringing with it powerful consequences for those who can muster the force, while still allowing a single magi to make use of it, albeit not to such great effect.

Skill       : Spirituality   Ability     : Smite
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Priests are terrible at hunting unless they specifically build their traits (nimble as opposed to quickwitted), race specialisation, and artifact purchases around hunting - after which they become moderately decent as opposed to amazing like many other classes. A good comparison would be intelligence monks - they can build for intelligence, but even bash monk bashing damage is amazing, so they don't suffer too much. This is especially noticable at lower levels when a lack of criticals makes base damage all the more important.

Solution #1:
Increase the base damage of smite and slightly decrease scaling with strength. Ideally, this would be a sizable increase, but leave the scaling at least a little attractive to encourage artifact purchases.
Solution #2:

Problem:
Disruptions were a great addition to Priest's offense, enabling a whole new line of offense based on afflictions. However, the 10 second delay based on the target makes disrupt require much more precision than reasonable in order to be used in group combat.

Skill       : Tarot          Ability     : Emperor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Flinging emperor at someone makes them follow you without using their balance, allowing you to then be instantly summoned with empress to another location - even to a defendable totem. This is exceptionally strong, and can even be used against the leader of a group to decimate the entire group. The biggest counter is to unfollow, but then it's a ping battle between announcing emperor and unfollowing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Make emperor follow use balance, preferably a little longer than .4s - the current balance for following.
Solution #2:
Solution #3:

Submitted by: Shiro          Status      : Submitted
Skill       : TwoArts        Ability     : Infusions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The infuse mechanic for TwoArts has too much random element built into it. The afflictions (or defstripping) are needed to stack afflictions in order to help ensure that an opponent is prepped for a Brokenstar. Oftentimes, the BM will spend all this time prepping limbs, then use infusions to supplement their breaks as the go for the kill move. Generally speaking, the BM has a limited amount of time to get their kill (due to impaleslash and hamstring's cure times/curing speed/etc). If they miss this window, they will have to start over. Having your infusion -not- fire after you've spent all this time setting up properly is very annoying considering that the failure is not due to your error, it is due to luck. This report seeks to rectify this.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the infused effect on a sword to always fire once it hits an opponent. Increase the cost of infusion to 8-10 shin.
Solution #2:
Allow an additional syntax to infusing (ex: infuse fire true) that guarantees that the element effect will fire when the weapon strikes the victim. This additional syntax costs 3-5 more shin on top of the initial cost of 5.
Solution #3:

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

It is said that atavians were humans gifted with wings long ago by Vastar, the Skylord, but the details of their beginnings remain shrouded in mystery. Regardless of their actual origin, it is true that most share a traditional devotion to Vastar. Many reside in Arcadia, a floating city hidden beyond the clouds, though a second settlement, Genji, within the Vashnar Mountains, also holds a high concentration of atavians.

Aside from their wings, atavians are a race very similar to humans. Their wings are typically white, though it is common to see a blue or grey tinge to the feathers. Other hues such as red, gold, and brown are unusual but do occur naturally. Their skin is pale and tans easily, though dark-skinned atavians are very rare. Hair and eye colour conforms to the typical human spectrum, as does their physique - that is, they may be found in all shapes and sizes.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here. Niks is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here. Niks is here, his head bowed. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here. Niks is here, his head bowed. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a spiritual mace in his right.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A steel-plated chair is here.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. A steel-plated chair is here. Purest Heart Dhaia Bayt al-Azhan is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her left hand. Predicant Garis 'The Jinx' Obuun is here.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. A steel-plated chair is here. Purest Heart Dhaia Bayt al-Azhan is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her left hand. Predicant Garis 'The Jinx' Obuun is here.

A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A steel-plated chair is here. Predicant Garis 'The Jinx' Obuun is here.

Blackstone parade ground.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. An explosive dust bomb is partially hidden on the ground.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Decidedly mellow, Soldier Aelios Azon is here.

Blackstone parade ground.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge. Decidedly mellow, Soldier Aelios Azon is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Phaestean Wordsmith, Silvarien Da'Navi is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption bearing the Divine Order arms of Phaestus in his right hand.

The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A miniature brazier of flawless crystal gleams steadily beneath a cloud of wood-scented smoke. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. Waddling nearby, a desert hedgehog snuffles eagerly at a scruffy girl's feet. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A steel-plated chair is here.
You see a single exit leading down.
