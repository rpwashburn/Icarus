Rally point.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

Palpable darkness in the unending reach of nothing
Textured madness becomes a swirling reality
A note becomes barely audible from a great distance

Eyes searching wildly to find a semblance of structure
Heart pounding in a rush of unbridled panic
The note becomes louder

Teeth grinding and cracking, tounge bloodied and ripped
Legs burning in an endless, uphill climb
Another note joins the first

A light, faint, then brighter
Growing fear guiding the hunger developing
The two notes contruct a simple, minor harmony

Walking, running, sprinting
A semblance of a window begins to take shape
Another note joins the first two

A look through the glass reveals a simple room
Three faceless entities stand in a circle
The three notes for a minor triad

Early birds around the morning Falls,
sing awake those sleeping dolls,
a serenade of chirping most pure,
nature's irresistable waking lure.

The snow-White gown of night's widow,
graces Targossas walking towards tomorrow,
following red sun rising high,
a daunting climb towards the sky.


Dancing sunlights in mid-day Falls,
where the Morningcloak enthralls,
elegant as a fullgrown swan,
the first warm kiss of a new dawn.

Liquid gold too fast to catch,
shimmering with a beauty quite hard to match,
refreshes the slumbering sense,
as a remedy to many muscles tense.


Fleeting stars within the midnight Falls,
at times when the moonlight calls,

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mark your devotion in a thousand cuts
In a thousand kisses, where doors open and shut
On a thousand knees, bloodied and torn
With the dreams both alive and stillborn.

Strike them blind so that they may see
Imperfection, bowing low, where perfection be
Abbadon their faces, soot awash in char
Cut their wings so they may fly far.

Beneath a thousand suns and argent moons
Petals so cold they burn, above battle bloom
In displeasure and pleasure, their will zoetic
A tongue for Them prays in whispers, frenetic.

Where a white willow grows
the earth is barren
its crackled flesh torn
landscape aberrant.

Roots churn and sink
nourishment found there
in blood's opposition
wellspring of despair.

Upward reach, pristine branches
then fall, whiplash tears
there, saintly sentinel
stains the ground in fear.

Your shadow is empty
ichor flows where sap was
vultures nest in your arms
glossy feathers, holy jowls.

Still you rise, lofty
encroaching the sky

Submitted by: Kaie           Status      : Submitted
Skill       : Puppetry       Ability     : Burn
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Puppet Burn is basically a useless skill. It sets the victim ablaze, which does not work with a "salve stack" due to the fact that specifying body parts such as "apply mending to legs" will bypass the flames and cure the broken leg. The damage received from it does not accumulate, nor is it significant by any means. I've tested this in the past having stopped curing and just sat there after puppet burn was inflicted upon me. Boar basically kept me at around full health even while being ablaze.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Change the function of Burn to sear the victim internally preventing the use of fitness/shrugging. This gives a fighting chance against fitness/shrugging opponents by forcing them to prioritize Burn over limb damage.
Solution #2:
Make Burn an instakill that incinerates the opponent if gone untreated for too long. It should be a restoration cure like Heartseed to again force the opponent to choose wisely given the situation.
Solution #3:
Replace Burn with a skill similar to hamstring in that it's time based and makes evade/backflip/sprint/etcetera unusable until it wears off.

Skill       : Pranks         Ability     : Slipperiness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Jester is one of the only classes, if not the only class, that does not have pvp damage reductions. The class used to rely heavily on dodging and escaping, but dodging took a heavy hit when Monk(The last real victim of dodging) got an accuracy boost as well as an easy workaround to dodging.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Implement PVP damage reduction to Slipperiness making it reduce damage in a similar fashion to scales.
Solution #2:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Given the fact that illusions are now obsoleted, Jester needs to compensate for that. A large part of combat for it was using illusions to deceive the opponent into doing something like disrupting aeon curing by illusioning something like asthma or sleep. It was also useful to buy time by forcing the opponent to lose balance, defenses are upkept and managed by the curing, so speed might be an issue aswell. It's been kind of a "trick" class, even though I hate to call it that, but now with the impact this has, the trick part is gone. We might as well take something beneficial from this and cross over into a more solid affliction class.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Create a new prop that can be wished for to deliver impatience.
Solution #2:
Remove the random factor from Itchpowder and replace it with a steady 2s tick that afflicts with Impatience.
Solution #3:
Give juggling a separate balance cost, similar to how dstab+illusion used to work. This would allow combat to proceed as it was without the need for an illusion to throw off aeon curing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
HocusPocus is a staple of Jester combat but has been rendered ineffective by server-side curing. Jesters current strategy is hindering/locking for an instakill, and viability has been reduced. I propose that Jester damage kills be made more viable.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Increase Throttle damage to scale more with artefacts so it reaches Kai Choke levels of strength.
Solution #2:
Put a timer between sipping Levitation and the defence coming up, like sipping Speed, so that balloonhandoff + throwing butterfly bombs is a tiny bit more effective.
Solution #3:
Increase the amount of damage that the returning javelins do from a juggled state.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
The effects of the Devil card wear off entirely too fast, and they're a one-time use for Jesters, whereas Occultists get multiple Devil flings with the use of Devilmark.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Allow the effects of Devil to be stacked up to 3x, so that flinging 3 Devils in a row will give you the Devil card effect 3x, but they wear off at the current rate.
Solution #2:
Give Jesters a devil-mark type ability.
Solution #3:
Create an ability for Jesters that, instead of throwing 2 cards under the effects of devil, has a chance of throwing 1 card and afflicting with asthma simultaneously.

Problem:
Jesters suffer from a stop/start nature to their combat, needing to stop all offense to rejuggle their weapons in order to use them effectively again. As it is essential to be able to deliver afflictions faster than 1 second as a Jester while the target is in Aeon, having to rejuggle forces the Jester to stop, allowing their target the opportunity to cure and/or escape.

Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : Illusion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Vodun illusion was one of the earliest forms of sympathetic magick roleplayed by shamans in the original Shamans Guild. Per Firefox, vision quests often involved the youngling roleplaying a long journey somewhere unfamiliar on prime plane and the mentor illusioning wonderful bits to help guide their walk in the class. Today, that's all vodun illusion is good for anymore. Its combat effectiveness has been totally stripped away for those utilizing server-side curing with Announce 4103.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Similar to the bonus given to serpents, give shamans the ability to fashion faster.
Solution #2:
Make the number of fashions gained completely randomized (somewhere between 1-4 fashions per tick), with truefashion being re-worked to allow dolls to remain fashioned slightly longer (without the mandatory 1-hour decay time).
Solution #3:
Allow shamans to curse faster.

Problem:
Just as submitted in Classlead 191, I also feel that illusions are an important aspect of Vodun and Shaman combat. My problem is that without it to help to deflect curing we should have some sort of rework to other abilities and a rework of how illusion is used now!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Have illusion cost no fashions what-so-ever and simply be useable upon creating a doll. Lower the fashions needed for Blackout of not replace illusion in fashion cost and use. I feel that with the fashion cost for blackout lowered the class itself will rather use blackout than illusions.
Solution #2:
Have illusion cost no fashions what-so-ever and simply be useable upon creating a doll. Have puncture cause a state 2 torso break at 20 fashions with 4 used.

Skill       : Vodun          Ability     : Bloodeffigy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Fashioning leaves Shamans wide open to attack, but unlike jesters, shamans have few reliable active or passive defenses (ie. hangedman for hindering, acrobatics, backhandspring, timers for bombs), and compared to Runewardens, Shamans don't have passives such as weathering, resistance and a lower armor class to offset higher damage input. It is necessary to bring the class in line with others as far as momentum and defenses are concerned.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Create a new ability in Vodun called Bloodeffigy, which is a passive ability that has a high chance upon cursing a target to extract a small amount of blood from them, transmuting the lifeblood into the making of the vodun doll, strengthening it with fashions. The blood effigy could also provide a life-link between the shaman and the doll, allowing a percentage of damage reduction based on intelligence and number of fashions on the doll. This will give shamans an alternative to "fashion ad nauseum hit and run strategies" and would build incentive for more direct combat.
Solution #2:
something else creative to bolster defenses and rework current class mechanics.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. An ash-grey jaguar pauses here, golden eyes alight. Pausing nearby on delicate legs is a bashful fawn. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.
