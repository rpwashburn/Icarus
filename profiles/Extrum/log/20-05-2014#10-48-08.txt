The Targossian barracks (indoors).
A wooden shelf, stained a deep, indigo hue, hangs upon the wall. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Covered in grime, a one-handed atavian boy playfully chases his friend around the barracks. There are 5 Brighthold watchmen here. A gilt-framed portrait of Draekar hangs upon a wall. Carefully buffed to a pristine shine, a steel strongchest rests upon the ground. Shining in silver armour, Lady Talarna, Paladin of Learning, stands here deep in thought. A waddling desert hedgehog snuffles nearby. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Perched upon a branch, a brightly coloured parrot scouts the area for shiny objects. A steel-plated chair is here. Caoimhaen is here, calm and relaxed. Sir Zenui Ruthras, Mnemosyne Templar is here. He wields a simple fishing pole in both hands. The Golden Dragon Tesha's imposing form looms. Marcen Shu'in-Crescent, the Argent Provisioner is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

Gateway to Targossas.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 Blackstone swordsmen here. There are 2 Riverwall bow-maidens here.

A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Towering above you, this massive mammoth has a thick, shaggy hide and long yellowed tusks. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A brilliant yellow lily lies here on the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A nebulous water weird is here. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier.  Seifur Maurois is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand. Soldier Seftin Azon is here, impassive. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and an ornate steel rapier in his right. Anedhel Azon, the Argent Hand is riding on a powerful black destrier.
