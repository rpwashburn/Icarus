----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.
