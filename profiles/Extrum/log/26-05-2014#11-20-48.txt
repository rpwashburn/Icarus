-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dearest Dajio,

 You say that only those not Free have Freedom within their minds. These are amusing words from one who willingly submits himself to the slavery of the Bloodsworn Gods.
 
 You, like your comrades, live life under penalty of banishment and death for the smallest of transgressions. You fight for a city which is routinely engaged in surveillance of its citizenry, too fearful and paranoid of betrayal or moral lapse. Is this something you can honestly call being free?

You are not able to choose your own path, it is being chosen for you, and you follow it like a blind fool. Mistake not what you are, Dajio. You are no less a slave than the lowest citizen of Mhaldor, simply chained to a different form of oppressor.
 
This is a slavery you have chosen for yourself, and one that only you can release yourself from. Continue to dream of Freedom, as you aid in the enslavement of others at blade-point. One day, I pray to the Lord, that you will remove the blindfold of the East and see the Light for what it is: an oppressive force, set on slaying all those who will not bend knee to its will.

Open your eyes, and take that first step to freeing yourself. We will be waiting.

As I look to the east and hear news of an ascension, I look to the source of these cheers and find my eyes settling upon a new face, untried and foreign to the world stage.

While Targossas turns to celebrate you, Havyn Shui'in-Crescent, as their new leader, so too will the soldiers of Evil celebrate with you in your glorious inheritance of a languorous city.

I have some unfortunate news to share with you, however. The fields of battle is not a playground for your likes, Dawnlady. You lack in strength by your inability to inspire and lead your motley troops into the thick of your three-fronted wars.

Yet, if you still seek to cement your place as the spearhead for the preservation of Creation, perhaps the West can assist you in further understanding how this is done. All you need to do is to identify the voice within that plagues you with weakness and halts you from wresting control of your true potential.

Then, rip this traitor from your body and cast it away. Unfetter your mind and offer unto His shrines your life.

The Seven Truths of the Master will not lead you astray. We will welcome you with open arms.

His Eternally,
Tyrannus Ruth I'llur

The Dawnspear has been built by the vision of the Bloodsworn Gods. The Light and Fire have guided our steps for building a foundation to resist, to combat, and to persevere through any and all threat to Creation. We, Their Army built and forged to fight for Creation in all ways will thrive even in the face of all the misguided attempts to destroy us.

Half hearted conversion attempts, words meant to wittle away at my resolve - these are the acts of your misguided path. The Truth is that all of Creation will flourish and Grow with my guidance as my choices are forged through effort and action and the will of the Bloodsworn will strengthen each step I take. The Dawnspear will surge forward.

Words, actions, drive - these are simple ways to lead and inspire - but let me remind you, Tyrannus, that through Righteousness our actions in service to Them will continue because in all our planning, in all our building, and in all our progress we take steps for Creation. To improve, to Grow, to see Their vision
through.

Let the Truth of the matter sink in, the depth of your plight flounder and flail into the certain realization: you cannot win.


In Their Service,

Dawnlord Havyn Shu'in-Crescent

Subject: Congratula...meh
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unlike the Tyrannus, I will not offer congratulations to the newest Dawnlady but instead express the collective sentiment of Sapience with a resounding "Meh."

We of Sapience remain firm in our beliefs that the new leadership will follow valiantly in the uncomfortably small boots of Silas in offering flowery declarations of fire, brimstone, and hell-fire by declaring war on shrines and Hashan. However, lest pessimism become the norm, we maintain the hope that perhaps the new Dawnlady will have the courage to do otherwise. Unfortunately, given the nature of tyrannies, we suspect that the Bloodsworn Gods will not allow this for this requires initiative, free-thinking, and of course, courage.

Oh well, at least for the brief span of minutes, we were hopeful that Targossas might live up to its supposed founding ideals but then we remembered its citizens and how such a glorious dream will be for not. You can take the citizens out of Shallam but to our great disappointment, you cannot take the Shallam out of the citizens.


Forever doing what I please,

Upon the eastern reaches of Sapience, the Bloodsworn Gods carved the land to Their whim, diverting the old Zaphar river to alter what was into what They desired, no regard or care given to the parts of Nature ripped out along the way. Instead, Their eyes remained solely upon Their singular goal of forming Creation to Their vision.

Out of this tragedy, new islands were formed, rivers flowed freely along their trek, and the flora and fauna thrived upon the destruction of what was.

Yet over this wonder, you laid down bricks and black stones, paved whole islands, constructed stately buildings and towering temples into the sky, ripping apart the natural beauty of the land itself.

When your city finally lies in the smoking remains of its ruins, the wilds will regrow and reclain what you have taken from Nature, entwining your crumbling walls into its eternal embrace.

My congratulations on your appointment to the esteemed position of Dawnlord by your Bloodsworn Gods.

However, I must say I find it thoroughly amusing that the young woman who was so often found playing in the shadows has been elevated to lead the zealots of Fire  and Light.

Yet, no doubt it is time to put away such frivolities and diversions, for the culling of that which blights Creation is a grave business indeed. I pray you have outgrown your meek spirit and tender heart, for the attrocities that will no doubt be committed by those you are now responsible for will fall solely upon your shoulders.

Just a friendly reminder that the Lucretian Athenaeum is accepting submissions. If you aren't sure what kind of works might be acceptable, then take a look around the different halls in teh library and the tomes currently available.

Submitting a tome to the library is easy! Merely drop the work into the box where Maejin stands. I check the box on a fairly regular basis, but if you send me a message, then I'll know to go check sooner than later. And if there is already a tome in the box, definitely let me know so yours can be next.

You can CHECKOUT a work from the room with the shelf that contains the journal, manuscript, or scroll you'd like to read. It will return on its own in due time, but you can CHECKIN the work from anywhere before that to chalk up an extra good deed.

Questions about the library and how it works? Send me a message or tell! I'm happy to help.

Best regards,

Subject: A Renaissance looms
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Age of Houses is poised to enter a new sphere of greatness!

The vision for houses in Achaea has not always been completely clear; indeed, it has been changing ever since the transition from the age of guilds. Until today! We are excited to present a refocused paradigm for houses in Achaea.

The ideal relationship between a city and its houses is a cohesive, symbiotic one. Each individual house brings unique and valuable strengths to the city; the identity of each house is clearly tied to the city of which it is part, and together the houses clearly exemplify the city's ideals as a whole. Conversely, the identity of the city itself is dependent on its member houses.

So, what will the specific situation look like? Each city will have three houses. All houses will allow all classes (with some limitations, e.g. Mhaldor will not allow classes with the Devotion skill). Thus, anyone in the city can belong to any one of its three houses.

I should interject here that part of the reason for this refocusing is the upcoming shift to multiclass. All players will potentially have access to not just one, but two (possibly more) classes that they can switch between. You can see that this makes it problematic for single-class houses to continue in their current form.

As a result, this shift bring significant changes to the organisation of every city and their houses. In the coming years, each city will enter a period of introspection and transformation. During this time, the leaders of the city and its houses will work closely with the Garden to evaluate the purpose and direction of both the city and its member organisations. Near the end of the process, the houses will close to new membership for a short time.

At the end of this time will come the Renaissance: three houses will open their doors for membership, and each will be open to all classes that the city accepts. Some houses will be relatively unchanged; others will be transformed; others may not exist in the same form that they do now. It will be different for each city.

Also as part of the Renaissance, a program of city novicehood will be introduced to the city, which all new citizens will undergo before choosing a house.

Because its houses were established according to the new paradigm, Targossas will not be undergoing this process. The city of Cyrene will be the first to enter this time of change, and we look forward to announcing the Cyrenian Renaissance in the next Achaean year!

Over the last few months the Lumarchs have been holding a series of informal meetings to discuss the state of the City and our own roles and responsibilities in regards to moving forward.

We have been blessed during this time to have had Havyn join our ranks as our Lumarch representing the Bloodsworn orders, and equally blessed to have had Lady Aurora present to guide our discussions as well. It probably helps that I have also returned from what was a long trip away, and so we have been able to discuss matters as a mostly complete gathering on several occasions in this period.

The primary outcome from these discussions is we are now working on a "living agenda", which is a collaborative effort to gather and focus the matters before us into an agenda for discussion and decision at what will now be regular Lumarch and or City Council meetings. The first of these will be scheduled for three to four months from now and they will occur on a regular basis thereafter.

Following this next meeting we will be scheduling a public meeting with the entire city as well in order to address questions and take feedback. This is an opportunity for all citizens to participate and provide their own thoughts and ideas into the work of the Council. I hope that many of you will be able to attend this meeting and that you can all please do so in a respectful and cordial manner so that we can make the gathering as productive as possible.

Alongside this we wanted the city to know that while things have been quiet of late this is by no means a sign that nothing is happening. Our Council is in a phase of renewal with the appointment of Havyn and with a review and audit of our Ministries about to begin. We expect a number of practical changes to take place around the operation of the Ministries and this is a priority for discussion at our next meeting.

On a related note our Ministry of Culture is also preparing for a Ball, the next Festival, and some other mini-events as well. We look forward with anticipation for these opportunities and I expect more information to flow on these in due course.

This has been a good last few years for our city, but we do hope to make the next few years even better. The opening of our Great Houses has drawn much time and energy from the city workings but as the Houses settle in we hope to be able to focus more energy back behind improving the city. We also want all citizens, both young and old to know that if they have the time and energy to help there is a place for them. Clearing the pathways for such citizen involvement is a priority for our Council.

Finally we would like all citizens to know that they are welcome to speak to any of the Lumarchs to voice their concerns or present their thoughts and ideas. We can't promise to respond to, and or  solve everything but as Lumarchs it is our role to take the thoughts and views of the citizens into our considerations and wherever possible any feedback given to us will find a place on our agenda for discussion.

Oh and finally for real this time. This post was titled the good, the bad, and an update. So before I end I must mention the bad.

It has come to the attention of the Council that some citizens are falling short where it comes to conduct and cordiality. Do know that you are all equally special, no more and no less special than those around you. Those found to be openly showing a lack of respect or courtesy towards their fellow citizens, especially those who are younger or with less privilege within the city will find themselves subjected to the ire of the Council and indeed our Bloodsworn Divine. Please do take this into careful consideration as such behaviour as has been reported to us on multiple occasions will not be tolerated, and this is a final warning for all concerned.

Alright, with that off my chest do know an update on the timing for our meetings will follow in the next month or two, and I look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming city meeting.

Subject: Restraint - remember why we fight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targossas,

We have been focusing our attention on the isle of filth and cowardice for a time now. Our city announce and our direction by Their decree have guided our swords, maces, and hands for a time now. We have seen more victories than defeats and we have, and will continue, to bring purifying Righteous Fire to burn their misguided followers and rattle the walls of their so-called Fortress. We will, in the name of the Lady of Truth bring Light to their doorsteps to combat the false truths of Mhaldor.

However, let us keep a firm understanding of who we are and how we get to where we need to be in the forefront of our actions. Righteousness must help each and every one of us to ensure that our actions are for the betterment of Creation so that Their vision may be realized. We have been fighting strong, rallying behind our ever diligent leaders and our zeal is unmatched by the cowardly, misguided heretics who hide behind the false truths, who only ever rally behind their so-called leaders.

Remember, Targossas, that we are tasked with great, necessary battles for much, much more than justice, vengeance, or honour. We fight not because we want to win but because we must win. Creation is to be safeguarded and protected so that Their vision may come to fruition - as such, it would be prudent to remember that while the citizens of Mhaldor walking the land should be taken seriously, we all must also remember to keep our wits about us and ensure that we are attacking those who have done wrong - who have been in the conflict, who have done more than sit, hiding behind the walls of Mhaldor. None are innocent, but we are not like the unleashed dogs of the so-called Bastion of the North and restraint will be had. Keep in mind that you cannot do your service to the Dawnspear, the Dawnguard and Army, or the Bloodsworn if you are only able to rustle occasionally.

Take my words seriously, take Their decree to heart, but none should be punished from above due to overzealous excitement and misdirected action. Keep this in mind in all of your choices during this conflict.

In Their Service,

Judicator Davio Op'Shae, Guardian of the Blades

Subject: The Bloodsworn Ball
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings Targossas,

I write to you all to officially announce the next Bloodsworn Ball! The last one was quite a while back, as some of you may remember, and was hosted by Tesha. Well the tradition has certainly not disappeared, and the next Bloodsworn Ball will be held in a little under a year in Daedalan of the year 656.

Now to set a few ground rules:

1) Attire: The Ball is a fashionable event, and you are to wear your very best. Dresses, tuxes, top hats, etc. Only the finest will be admitted. We will also be holding a fashion contest for one male and one female, so dress to impress.

2) Entry: To gain entrance you will be required to pass a check by the Ministry of Security. If Antidas or his aides find you lacking, you will be certainly sent away. The required article to enter the Ball will be a ribbon that you may purchase at the event. I'd advise purchasing multiple ribbons, they are quite nice. You must also put away or stow any weapons or armour upon entry. You may certainly have them on your person, in case something were to arise of course, just merely don't wield or wear them! Such articles almost certainly will get our lovely ladies' dresses dirty anyway.

3) Behavior: Have fun, but not too much! We are, after all, honoring our beloved Bloodsworn. Act appropriate. I'm certainly not saying you can't get crazy, but try to contain any fights or wrestling matches (this one goes out to you, Dwarves).

4) Come hungry!: There will be food and enormous amounts of alcohol available, of course!

I hope to see everyone there, and hope we all have a good time. The entire city has worked endlessly these past few years, and I think everyone deserves at least one night off! Keep your ears open for an exact date regarding the Ball, and get ready!

In service to Them,

Micaelis Bayt al-Azhan

Subject: My Resignation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Targossas,

My time has come.

I took on the mantle of being the first Dawnlord of Targossas, blessed and humbled by the faith shown in me by the Bloodsworn. Many of you will know of my past, and I am certain there are those among you who will have had misgivings about my tenure.

It is my hope that I have repaid Their faith in me through my service to this, Their city, and it is my hope that I have shown those doubters that through Good all may be redeemed.

But it is time for me to step aside and to allow somebody else the opportunity to lead the Dawnspear ever on.

It has been the greatest honour to lead this city, the one true beacon of Good, of Light, and of Righteousness in these lands. I will be forever grateful for the opportunity I was afforded, and for the strength, the tenacity, and the faith that you have all shown in what we are building here in Their land.

Targossas is a city alone on Sapience, but she is also a city united under a singular common cause. We derive our strength, all of us, from this unity, and I expect you all to show my successor the support and the tireless drive that you have ever shown me.

A new chapter shall unfold for the Dawnspear, and I am excited again to see what the future will bring.

May the Light lead, Targossas, and may we never fail to follow.


In Their eternal service,

Silas Maynard de l'Evanoir
Dawnlord of Targossas

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawnspear,

Long have I walked the streets of our beautiful city with insurmountable pride and honour. Long have I sheathed weapons, judged heathens, and absolved the souls of those I was able. Long have I stood in service to Them, and to my City. This has come to an end, for a time.

It is with a heavy heart I advise of my slumber. I do not know when I will wake, but I know in my heart of hearts that when I do, this City will have grown, and I know that Targossas will stand as She already does; as the glistening beacon of all that is beautiful in this world. I know that She will overcome all adversities, She will stand tall and will shine ever-brilliantly upon the forces of Evil and Darkness.

To those Ministries of which I offer my service, I apologise for not having been able to speak to each of you separately. To the new Dawnlady, I offer my congratulations and know you will perform as adequately as Silas has done in the role. To the Admiral of our glorious Navy, I trust you will continue with as much gusto as I have had, all these decades. To my Housemates, continue to develop and grow. To the young of the City, do as much as you can, for as many people as you can. You all have something to offer, as insignificant as you deem it to be.

Stand tall, Targossians, and be well.

Until I wake,
Avianca Shu'in-Crescent

A bustling farrier's yard.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Humming under his breath, Mahmoud toils over his tools. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A war horse stands here, stamping impatiently. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. There are 2 alabaster pegasi here.  Seifur Maurois is here. He wields an ornate steel rapier in each hand.

All hail Lord Sartan! Our Lord has tasked us this year with piking the heads of twenty enemies at the gates of Mhaldor, and converting three heathens. As the Blood Congregation, demonstate to Mhaldor, and all of Sapience why we are to be feared, and why our Lord's orders are absolute. Focus your efforts on both those new to the world, and established adventurers. We will not fail in the task assigned to us.

Focus hard on aiding the young Malefics. They are our future and the Master requires competent new preachers of His will.
