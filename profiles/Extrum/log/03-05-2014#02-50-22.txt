The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
You see exits leading south, southwest, and west.

There is currently a City credit sale in progress.
----[ Targossas City announcement ]----
The focus for the time-being is solely on eradicating all traces of the visible influence of the Skylord. All attention should be given over to defiling His shrines. Time wasted on defiling shrines to Sartan, Ourania, Babel and Twilight only gives Vastar's Order the opportunity to rebuild. We shall continue our work in stamping out what feeble efforts the rest of our enemies put forth when we are finished with Vastar.

Today I put my blades down, as they no longer serve me purpose. I have nothing left to fight for.

Perhaps one day, they will find purpose again.

Enter the realm of the bramble
Trip and fall upon thorns
The bark scraping the flesh from you
The branches gouging your flesh
Howling echoes deafen you
The running rivers drive you to madness
The dirt drags you down

May your blood soak the earthen floor
Roots run through you
Absolute hell for your kind
You try to kill it
You try to burn it
You try to crush it
You try in vain

You are disfigured
You are cut asunder
Your limbs are ripped from you
Your life is taken
The ancient grounds mock you
The timeless trees rip out your heart
Gleaming teeth gnaw at you relentlessly

The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. A rugged war goat stands here, gnawing on the leather bit of its reins. A winged beast lurks in the shadows, its crimson eyes glowing brightly.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.
