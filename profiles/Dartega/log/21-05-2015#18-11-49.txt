There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.

Stygian Crossroads.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Live without the constraints of Virtue and nothing will be denied you." A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A small mhun miner has been nailed upon a ridged, blood stained cross and left to perish. The cadaverous figure here atop the Idol of Corruption seethes with hatred. A large school of piranha swims here inside a deep, murky pool. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. There are 4 knights of the Maldaathi here. The leather-bound Apocrypha lies closed upon an obsidian pedestal. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A look of disgust plastered across his face, Mhaldorus intently surveys his surroundings. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A crystalline golem stands here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. An elegant bloodstone bench is here. A black bone chest is here. Tyrannus Xinna, Dread Legate is here. Her features are obscured by a mask. She wields an elegant Mhaldorian rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right. You may ENTER SUBDIVISION from here.

Stygian Crossroads.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Live without the constraints of Virtue and nothing will be denied you." A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A small mhun miner has been nailed upon a ridged, blood stained cross and left to perish. The cadaverous figure here atop the Idol of Corruption seethes with hatred. A large school of piranha swims here inside a deep, murky pool. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. There are 4 knights of the Maldaathi here. The leather-bound Apocrypha lies closed upon an obsidian pedestal. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A look of disgust plastered across his face, Mhaldorus intently surveys his surroundings. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A crystalline golem stands here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Live without the constraints of Virtue and nothing will be denied you." A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A small mhun miner has been nailed upon a ridged, blood stained cross and left to perish. The cadaverous figure here atop the Idol of Corruption seethes with hatred. A large school of piranha swims here inside a deep, murky pool. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. There are 4 knights of the Maldaathi here. The leather-bound Apocrypha lies closed upon an obsidian pedestal. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A look of disgust plastered across his face, Mhaldorus intently surveys his surroundings. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A crystalline golem stands here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. An elegant bloodstone bench is here. A black bone chest is here. Tyrannus Xinna, Dread Legate is here. Her features are obscured by a mask.

9.2 HYPNOSIS


Where a skill like Venom is a naturally developed ability, and a skill like
Subterfuge is an ability with many magical elements, Hypnosis is a science. It
has long been known that our subconscious mind is a powerful force and that it
can be influenced in mysterious ways, but until a forgotten Serpentlord
discovered the principles of Hypnosis, there was no way to use it.

With this skill, you will be able to sink someone into a hypnotic trance,
possibly even without them realising it, and implant various subliminal
suggestions. You then seal your victim's mind and implant a timer that
determines how long after the hypnosis has been triggered until the suggestions
start becoming active.


HYPNOTISE <adventurer>
     - Will start the process.

SUGGEST <adventurer> <suggestion>
     - Will implant a subconscious suggestion. You may implant as many
       hypnotic suggestions as you wish while your victim is under your
       trance.

SEAL <adventurer> <time>
     - Will seal the adventurer off and bring him out of his trance, the
       time being the amount of time before the first hypnotic effect will
       be activated after the snap.

SNAP <adventurer>
     - Will trigger the hypnosis. Note that _any_ adventurer can trigger
       hypnotic suggestions this way.

Starting a new hypnosis on a person will clear out all previous hypnotic
suggestions, so be sure to implant all the suggestions you wish a person to
have BEFORE sealing them.

Note that only Analyse, Cleanse, Action, and Mesmerise have ability help
scrolls. The rest are all suggestions, and you simply do SUGGEST <adventurer>
<ability name>.

Subject: Lessons and Chocolates
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce that for the rest of February, we'll have bulk lesson packages available on the website! You will find them at a cheaper rate than credits, with packages from 250 - 10000 lessons! As always, you'll get a 10% additional lessons if you're an Iron Elite subscriber, so hurry in, as they'll only be around until the end of the month!

There's been an outcry for more chocolates (and I suspect an uptake in demand for plus-sized clothing), so you'll continue to receive a pouch of them for every 100cr purchased on Achaea.com for the rest of the month too!

Penned by My hand on the 12th of Chronos, in the year 676 AF.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Here stands a restless mountain eagle, arrogantly surveying his surroundings. Vigilant, an umbral tiger crouches on his haunches. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light.  Tyrannus Xinna, Dread Legate is here. Her features are obscured by a mask. She wields an elegant Mhaldorian rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right.
You see a single exit leading west.

Stretching its wings in an impressive display is an ebony pegasus, its dark coat absorbing the surrounding light. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning.

We're offering something a little different this week, a chance to pick up an out-of-subdivision housing plot! We've just unveiled 15 new plots with impending availability! Check out PLOTS FOR SALE (when not in a subdivision) to see the list of locations and prices. You'll have until the Serenade tomorrow to inspect these beautiful locations, and then when the dulcet notes reverberate across the firmament at 00:00 GMT tomorrow, you'll be able to PLOT BUY (while standing in the room) to make your purchase. Get prepared to buy, we anticipate that these will go quickly!

Subject: Plot Sale - FAQ
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Just some further information regarding the plots for sale, based on the myriad questions that have been asked:
1) Being a transferrable commodity, they're purchasable with unbound credits only.
2) Plots will remain for sale until purchased.
3) The first person to enter the PLOT BUY command on the plot after the serenade will have ownership transferred to them.
4) PLOT BUY will have a small balance cost attached, to prevent spamming.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce that all of the Iron Realms games now support Bitcoin payments for purchases! For those that don't know what Bitcoin is, it is an online payment system that uses a decentralised "cryptocurrency" (a bit too long to explain here, but look it up if you're interested in learning more).

At this time, we only accept the payments for one-time purchases, meaning that you can not currently pay for Iron Elite memberships with it. If/when this changes, I'll let you know!

Subject: Sentinel and Druid Overhauls
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the Ventos Allegos swept through the Ithmia, it was not just the houses of Eleusis that were caught in the transfiguring winds. Both the Druid and Sentinel classes have received major overhauls today!

Druids
======
* Druids gain a brand new skill, RECLAMATION! Replacing the Concoctions skill, this new set of abilities allows a Druid to extend the reach of nature beyond the edges of the forest. Stone and iron pose little threat to the encroaching grasp of nature!

Sentinels
=========
* Sentinels gain a fearsome new arsenal of abilities with the skill of SKIRMISHING, a focus on destroying their enemies with a variety of natural and unnatural weapons. They will also enjoy massive changes to their woodland companions, with a slew of new abilities in Woodlore!

Adventurers have had their skill level in Concoctions moved directly across to Reclamation or Skirmishing, depending on their class.

Other changes
=============
Metamorphosis
-------------
* WYVERN is now a Druid-only morph, alongside HYDRA.
* JAGUAR and BASILISK are now Sentinel-only morphs.
* SUMMONed FLAME now builds faster.
* IGNITE has been reworked. It will now increase the summoned flame heat by two levels, but now has a cooldown between use.
* INFERNO has been reworked. It is now faster, but less damaging, and will reignite the target after a period of time.
* INCINERATE now requires white fire to be summoned.
* WREATHE has been added to the WYVERN morph.
* BLAZE has been added to the WYVERN morph.
* DISMEMBER has been added to the JAGUAR morph.
* PETRIFY has been added to the BASILISK morph.
* REFLEXES has been removed from all morphs.
* MAUL, when used in WYVERN morph, can no longer miss.
* ROAR, when used in HYDRA morph, will now prone the target.
* HYDRA morphs powers have had their balance costs reevaluated.
* Frozen POUND is no longer an instakill. Its damage and balance costs have been reworked to be generally more effective with the new skills.

Subject: Command stacking
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After adding in the command stacking in aliases, we examined how a lot of people were using them, including the ability to batch commands. Rather than messing around with creating an alias to do that, we've built the functionality into your every day life! You can now CONFIG COMMANDSEPARATOR <character> to send multiple commands at once!

For example:
CONFIG COMMANDSEPARATOR |    - Set the separator to "|"
HI TECTON|HI SARAPIS         - Batch the commands HI TECTON and HI SARAPIS
OUTR MYRRH|EAT MYRRH         - Batch the commands OUTR MYRRH and EAT MYRRH
CONFIG COMMANDSEPARATOR NONE - Clear your configured command separator.

There are some limitations to this:
* A maximum of 10 commands may be stacked at once.
* Multi-command aliases can not be used in conjunction with this.

Enjoy!

Subject: Weapon Damage Against Denizens
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've recently done some balancing on the damage done to denizens with weapons, helping to address some of the outliers now that weapons have fairly standardised stats.

These changes should be most noticeable to users of Weaponmastery, as there were a number of behind-the-scenes changes there so that knight classes will do better balanced damage to denizens across all skillranks.

Classes that don't use weapons in their primary hunting attack will now find that weapon attacks against denizens will most likely do less damage. Your class attacks should be unaffected and should always be your preferred hunting attacks.

If you encounter any situations where denizen damage is still wildly out of whack (like newbies doing too little/much damage at low levels, or a particular weapon doing crazy amounts of damage), please do let us know (with a BUG report or you can message me directly) so that we can get it fixed up quickly.

Subject: April Promotion - Part 2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce April's promotion: a brand new talisman set! Steeped in tradition, it is focused on the eternal battle between the Ivory and Quisalis marks. For every 100 credits purchased on Achaea.com, you'll receive a talisman piece, with an additional piece being granted for every 500 credits purchased. So if you purchase 2000 credits, you'll receive 24 talisman pieces (that's 4 free)!

As with the previous Conclave set, these pieces are able to be sold, traded, or redeemed for a portion of the value of the completed artefacts!

While they're themed around the Ivory and Quisalis Marks, they're available to all adventurers, regardless of Mark membership.

Here's the list of the available items in this set:

Ivory Mark
----------
A Warhorn of Heroes (ivorywarhorn)
- Challenges an adventurer to an arena duel to the death in the Delosian Arena. This challenge will be broadcast to the world, and your opponent has the option to ACCEPT or DECLINE the CHALLENGE.

A Champion's medallion (ivorymedallion)
- This medallion will confer a bonus to experience for slaying members of the Quisalis Mark. This only applies to adventurer kills.

A Sangrean spyglass (ivoryspyglass)
- Granting enhanced sight of the Quisalis Den, this spyglass will allow adventurer to see the ranks of the Quisalis Mark in the Realms. MARKWHO will reveal the list.

An Ivory pennon (ivorypennon)
-  A sign of affiliation with the Ivory Mark, this pennon will confer a small experience bonus to the wearer when hunting Denizens in the the Quisalis Den, under New Thera.

A spiralled Silver Arrow armband (ivoryarmband)
-  As a loyal supporter of the Ivory Mark, this item bestows a custom deathsight message upon the owner while worn. For kills attributed to the wearer, adventurers will see: "As a beacon of the Ivory Mark, <Killer> has vanquished <Victim>."

An armed Atlantia dummy (ivoryatlantia)
- Perfect for your next Mark-related performance, or just to tell a horrible joke, this ventriloquist's dummy has been fashioned to look like Atlantia, leader of the Ivory Mark. Wielders can DUMMY <dummy> SAY <whatever> to make the dummy speak.

A Champion's training dummy (ivorydummy)
- Howl with righteous fury as your wail upon this training dummy. You can drop it anywhere and then attack it for up to one Achaean day. All attacks that work on denizens may be used on this item.

A miniature Ivory Tower (ivorytower)
- A perfect replica of the Ivory Tower, this item may be TURNed to transport the adventurer to the Sangre Plains and the halls of the Ivory Mark. This item will only work on the continent of Sapience, and requires the user to be in good general health.

Subject: New GMCP additions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've just loaded up a new addition to Achaea's GMCP implementation - afflictions and defences! You'll see this used to great effect in the next version of our HTML5 client, but we've opened this up for you all now.

How it works
============
Afflictions
-----------
* When you receive an affliction, you'll get a Char.Afflictions.Add GMCP message. Masked and hidden afflictions (Loki venom, for example) will not send this message.
* Symptoms of masked afflictions will reveal the presence of the affliction and send the Affliction.Add message.
* Using the DIAGNOSE command will reveal the presence of all masked afflictions and send a Char.Afflictions.List message.
* Curing afflictions will send a Char.Afflictions.Remove message.

Defences
--------
* When you gain a defence, you'll get a Char.Defences.Add GMCP message.
* Using the DEFENCES/DEF command will send a Char.Defences.List of all of the defences you currently have active.
* Losing a defence will send a Char.Defences.Remove message. Silently stripped defences will not send this message.

Subject: Venser's Achievement
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For centuries, one goal has been the singular obsession of some of Achaea's greatest minds. One mountain's peak has stood above all others, and all climbers failed in their quest to stand upon its glorious pinnacle and bask in the adoration and envy of the lesser beings arrayed about them.

Until today. For today, Venser, the famed Alchemist of Ashtan, conquered that mountain. With courage and style, he put on his crampons and climbing ropes and he did what it took to succeed. He watched as his compatriots fell into crevasses, dying in screaming terror. He persevered through the mighty storms that whip the mountain's slopes. He battled the elements in all their Vastarian fury. And, eventually, he clawed his way to the top, thereby achieving immortality in our memories. Forever will Venser be known as First among Flippers. Bow to his mastery and majesty!

TL;DR: Venser has become the first person in Achaea's history to flip a coin and have it land on its edge, earning a custom honours line for it. Congrats!

Subject: New version of the client!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce the latest version (2.4) of our web client is ready for public beta testing! You can access it here: http://newclient.achaea.com

Please test it out and use the 'feedback' tab in the settings menu (accessed via the little gears in the lower right) to file bug reports relating to the client.

Here's what new in this version:

* Completely new graphical interface.
* Icons breaking inventory and room items by high level category.
* Multiple help files can be examined at once now.
* You can now toggle off the character portrait, macro buttons, and graphical gauges.
* Reworked backend allowing for a simpler window/tab interface.
* There are two kinds of windows: pinned and unpinned. Pinned windows are the five windows in the default layout, and they will scale with the available space in your browser window.
* Unpinned windows are created by dragging a tab off a window into elsewhere.
* Unpinned windows can be moved around and easily resized, but they will not rescale based on window size.
* You can drag additional tabs onto the tabs area of an unpinned or pinned window in order to move it there.
* You can right - click to rep in area window, which will make it return to its default space or window.
* You can also right - click to toggle windows on or off.
* When communication shows up in the  comm window while it's not the selected tab in a window, you'll see a notice.
* The client will now scale which windows are visible based on your window resolution. Basically, there are setups for a full PC/laptop, a tablet, and a phone.
* Improved network backend, allowing connections from computers that have telnet blocked by proxy servers and firewalls.
* Improved performance generally.

Subject: Torc of Telepathy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of this current Classlead season, we've been monitoring the effectiveness of the Torc of Telepathy artefact. When combined with affliction classes, it's abundantly clear that the artefact provides overpowering advantages when it comes to applying and maintaining affliction pressure.

The team and I have been debating tweaks and changes to try and lessen the unbalanced nature of the artefact, while still keeping it useful, but it has become abundantly clear that it would result in either the artefact being useless or still ridiculously strong. As such, we've removed the artefact and refunded the purchase price to adventurers who had previously purchased this artefact. Those with customised torcs have been gifted with a featureless ice figurine, to be applied to a future customisation request.

We're always making tweaks and adjustments to make sure you guys have the best playing experience. One of the ways we've recently improved things is more automatic grouping, and reducing the number of items that are generated with common activities. Here's the details:

* OUTR/OUTD/OUTQ will now group multiple items when removed from their relevant storage rift. OUTQ 50 METEOR will now make a single group of 50 arrows, rather than 50 individual ones.

* SPLIT can now only support a maximum of 50 groups. If you have groups of the item in your inventory, you'll be limited to 50 groups total at any one time.

* Arrows can only be OUTQ'ed in groups of 50.

Looking back at the Mark talisman promotion so far, we've realised that we've undervalued the price of the Atlantia and Derillin dummy artefacts. You'll find that they're now worth double what they previously were (both the completed artefact and the pieces). As way of apology, we've gone through and gifted everyone with an additional free piece for every 500 credits purchased (across all purchases made this month, rounded down).

If you've already TALISMAN REDEEM'ed a piece for the previous lower amount, please let me know, and I'll make sure you get the additional credits to bring you up to the current value.

Subject: Housing changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As promised in recent announce posts, a batch of housing changes have gone live, oriented mainly around turning housing into a gold sink rather than a credit sink. The details are all in the HELP HOUSING files, but to run down the important ones:

 * You should now have 10x as many room credits as you had before, plus 1 extra room credit for every door credit you had.
 * Everything that cost room credits before now costs 10x as many, so 10 room credits to buy a room.
 * Door credits are no more.
 * Half-room credits are no more.
 * Room credits now cost 200 wood and 100 stone. At current comm prices, that's about 60% of what they would have cost previously if you bought credits on the credit market with gold.
 * Titling, describing, creating exits are more expensive than before.
 * Doors cost one room credit, and you can trade them back in for a room credit.
 * Rooms trade back in for 5 room credits (half, as before).
 * There's no selling of room credits any more.
 * Servants are more expensive, but reaction slots for them are much cheaper.

I'm probably missing things, but those are the big ones!

Subject: wood and stone production, plus new commodity shops
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The villages of Sapience and Meropis, in response to increased demand for wood and stone from adventurers, have cranked up production of those comms.

In addition, the increased demand has prompted the people of the isles of Tuar and Zaphar to open commodity shops selling wood and stone specifically.

Subject: Join the team - become a Celani!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever wish you could help shape Achaea? Do you secretly desire to take on more of a "game master" role, designing elaborate plots and scenarios to challenge and amaze adventurers? Now's your chance, with applications now being open for Celani! This is your chance to leave behind the shackles of a mortal existence and take on the mantle of one of our Pantheon.

We're currently seeking applicants with a very strong roleplaying focus. Successful candidates will be self-motivated, adept at thinking on their feet, and won't shy away from diving into immersive player interaction on any scale. If you think you have what it takes to craft and execute compelling and consistent roleplaying events, please read on!

In order to apply, you must meet the following criteria:
- You must be 18 years or older IRL. Sorry, minors!
- You must have, at absolute minimum, at least 500 hours of playing time.
- Read HELP CELANI and HELP PROMOTIONS in full.

Now, here's what you must include in your application, in a plain-text, non-formatted email to celani@achaea.com:

1. Your real name.

2. Your real age.

3. If you are primarily a student, tell us your school and your course of study. Otherwise: your real occupation and your company's name.

4. Your character(s) in Achaea and what you have accomplished through those characters, especially any leadership positions you have held or other noteworthy achievements.

5. Why you think we should make you a Celani (keeping in mind that Celanihood precedes Godhood, so also why you think you should have the chance to be a God).

6. Why you want to do this, knowing that you will have to completely cut off ties with other (mortal) players and leave behind all that you accomplished as a mortal player.

7. Two flawless room descriptions of 80+ words each. You MUST READ the section on room descriptions at the bottom of the HELP MORTAL BUILDERS file and follow the writing guidelines therein. DO NOT SKIP THIS. The MAJORITY of applications I've received in the past have ignored some part of the explicitly stated writing guidelines. What this tells me is that you lack attention to detail and the ability to follow given instructions, and neither of these traits make good Celani candidates.

8. A brief outline for an IC event, totalling 100 - 200 words. This should be of the scale that you see in our regular EVENTS news posts, and should involve at least two of Achaea's player-run organisations (i.e. Cities, Houses).

9. Any special experience outside of Achaea that you think might help you in Celanihood, such as customer service background or writing experience.

Strong writing skills are a must, as is the ability to work within an often demanding and perfectionistic team environment. Other traits that will help you: consistency, creativity, improvisational skills, storytelling ability, maturity, attention to detail, dependability, and above all, a love of Achaea and the world we co-create here.

Your application MUST be received by 23:59 GMT on Monday, May 4th (8pm Eastern, 5pm Pacific, and 10am (Tuesday) Sydney).

Subject: Golden Giftbags!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the month of May, we're pleased to announce the triumphant return of Golden Giftbags! These are special bags that you'll receive with every 50 credits purchased from Achaea.com!

Golden giftbags come in 7 different levels. When you make your purchase, you receive a default (or level 0) giftbag. If you look inside, you'll see some herbs, sigils, inks, and gold. But don't take anything out yet! If you're feeling lucky, you can try to upgrade your giftbag to the next level... which could mean artefacts, credits, and more!

How does it work? Simple! GIFTBAG UPGRADE <bag> will attempt to upgrade your giftbag's contents to the next level of prizes. Be warned, however, that there is only a -chance- that your attempt will succeed. Higher level giftbags have a progressively lower chance of success.

In the event that luck is not on your side, and your upgrade is unsuccessful, don't worry, your back will be reverted back to its default contents, so you're never going to lose out on getting anything from a giftbag!

Once an item is removed from a giftbag, or if an upgrade attempt is unsuccessful, that bag can no longer be upgraded.

Upgrade levels:
0 - Default level at which all giftbags start: you'll get some herbs, sigils, inks, and gold.
1 - Runic vials containing stat, experience, and critical hit boosting elixirs, or clay chips (worth 20cr to trade-in).
2 - Artefact pipe, Artefact vial, or ivory dice.
3 - Dragonskin quiver, drinking horn, Dagger of Reincarnation, or Serpentine Keyring.
4 - One of the level 1 artefact weapons.
5 - Wand of Reflections, Eagle's wings, Buckawn Amulet, or Wand of Portals.
6 - Veil of the Sphinx, Gem of Rapid Transmutation, Grimoire of Hasty Adaptation, or Girdle of Aegis.

Here's the available commands to check and manipulate the bags:
GIFTBAG CHECK <bag>   - Check whether or not a giftbag can be upgraded, and what the next tier prizes are.
GIFTBAG UPGRADE <bag> - Throw the dice and try for an upgrade.

FAQs
----
Can I sell my giftbag?
- Yes! The contents will be loyal/resetting (if applicable) to whoever removes them, so you can gift/trade/sell golden giftbags to other people.

Can I trade in an artefact I got from a giftbag?
- Yes! Once removed from the giftbag, artefacts that can normally be traded in (that's pretty much everything but the runic vials) may be traded in.

* Hollowed skull: This gruesome item serves as the game board for the "Safe Passage" game. Syntax: READ SKULL.

* Seaworn dice: Gamble your fate on a throw of the dice! A variety of effects and rewards are only a roll away! Syntax: THROW <dice>.

* Wrecker's crate: Salvaged from the murky depths, this well-constructed crate contains one of a series of seaworthy furnishings for your ship's deck.

* Wicker basket: A new creature to roam your vessel!

* Black finned flare: This mystical flare, when lit, will reveal a count of all ships within the same sea or ocean as your seaborne vessel. Syntax: LIGHT <flare>.

Enjoy, ye salty dogs!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've just tweaked out golden giftbag promotions to incorporate a concept known as "bad luck mitigation" which, in basic terms, will prevent a string of bad luck when attempting to upgrade the giftbags. If you fail to upgrade a gift bag, you'll receive a bonus to your next upgrade chance. This effect stacks, so say that you're unlucky on two bags in a row, you'll receive double the bonus on your next bag.

For those of you who have already obtained giftbags this month already, you've been gifted with a free bag on us!

Subject: Mark and contract changes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce an overhaul to the way contracts are handled in the Ivory and Quisalis Marks! Gone are the days of random distribution to any member of the organisation - now all contracts will be placed on a board inside their Mark headquarters.

For adventurers putting out contracts
-------------------------------------
* Adventurers placing contracts will now arrange for the deed to be done through a contract broker. A cowled figure has taken up residence in the bar of each of the cities, as well as in the Brass Lantern Inn.

* Contracts are now more resilient! In the event of a Mark member taking the contract and going dormant, it will be returned to the board for reallocation.

* If the contract target goes dormant, a contract will automatically complete after a certain amount of time, granting the customer the experience reward.


For Assassins and Champions
---------------------------
* As mentioned above, contracts are now placed on a board in the Ivory and Quisalis Mark headquarters. An alert will be sent to all online members shortly after a new contract is placed. Simply head to the board and CONTRACT CLAIM <#>.

* Contract parties are relatively anonymous (both payer and target information being limited to their city affiliation) until claimed.

* Assassins and Champions can claim one contract per 24 hours (24 Achaean days), but if they successfully complete a contract, this time limit is reset.

* Mark rankings have been reset.

* Order writs, when yielded to the system, will be placed on the board as normal. They will have a 24 hour exclusivity window (only visible to members of that order) before becoming available to the entire organisation. Order writs no longer increase rankings within the Marks.

* Mark members who fail too many contracts will be removed from the Mark, and be unable to join again for 5 Achaean years.

* Mark members who fail to take a contract in 3 Achaean years will be removed from the Mark and unable to join again for 1 IG year.

* The cost to join either Mark has increased to 20,000 gold.

I just loaded up a small change to the POSES system, allowing you to set a pose that is cleared when you leave the room. Just use the TPOSE command instead of POSE!

There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. Here stands a restless mountain eagle, arrogantly surveying his surroundings. Vigilant, an umbral tiger crouches on his haunches. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby.

A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face.

A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A small mhun miner has been nailed upon a ridged, blood stained cross and left to perish. The cadaverous figure here atop the Idol of Corruption seethes with hatred. A large school of piranha swims here inside a deep, murky pool. A sewer grate looms darkly beneath your feet. There are 4 knights of the Maldaathi here. The leather-bound Apocrypha lies closed upon an obsidian pedestal. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. A look of disgust plastered across his face, Mhaldorus intently surveys his surroundings. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A crystalline golem stands here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A many-headed hydra towers over the area, his carmine scales glimmering like gems. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A jet-black falcon glides just above, looking for prey. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. An elegant bloodstone bench is here. A black bone chest is here. You may ENTER SUBDIVISION from here.

Roguishly handsome, this youthful satyr hums to himself as he admires the glinting of his blade in the light. Stunning green eyes boldly assess all who pass by, a good-natured challenge evident in his questioning gaze. Golden curls tumble over his forehead and the tops of his ears, boyishly tangling around the base of his horns. Dressed in black leather trousers and a crimson-hued silk shirt, his toned physique is displayed for maximum effect, and the crooked grin he wears only serves to confirm the calculation undertaken in his appearance. A glass flute hangs in a protective sheath at his waist, his free hand hovering always near.
A dashing troubadour exudes an aura of overwhelming power.

A paragon of humility and grace, this aged monk stands still and utterly at ease, a testament to the tranquillity achieved through adherence to the Mojushaine ideals. Remarkably unaffected by the enduring cold of the mountains, his unassuming form is clad only in a modest grey robe secured with a featureless silk belt. His bare feet support his toned and exposed calves, and his callused hands, though folded restfully at his waist, speak of cautiously contained strength. A faint, secretive smile plays over his thin lips, and wrinkles line his dark eyes, a reminder of the long and arduous path to enlightenment.
A venerable monk exudes an aura of overwhelming power.
He has 100% health remaining.
He weighs about 180 pounds.
He is loyal to The City of Cyrene.

Graceful and poised, this mountain archer turns her dark eyes to the heavens. Her sleek snow panther prowls slowly, her predatory gaze equally alert as they scan the area in well-trained accord. The light and lithe form of the middle-aged Tsol'aa is warmly dressed in durable doeskin, and a quiver of diamond-tipped arrows hangs at her side. Gloved hands cradle a beautifully crafted darkbow, the wood treated and oiled to a lustrous shine. Silver hair escapes from an intricate knot at the back of her head, each loose strand framing her angular face like the wisps of fog that wreath the distant peaks.

Brimming with energy, a sooty Dardanic colt waits impatiently nearby. A silvery Dardanic mare stands here with a graceful presence. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. Curving her neck coquettishly, a dappled Dardanic filly nibbles at her shoulder.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here.
