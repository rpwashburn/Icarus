Subject: A new day for the HTML5 client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With the release of the latest version of the HTML5 client, we felt that things were looking really great except for one small thing... the name! HTML5 isn't something that inspires people, so moving forward, the client will be known as Nexus!

"But what about the old java client that was called Nexus?" I hear you ask. Well, we've officially marked that as end-of-life. It will no longer be updated or supported moving forward (in fact, it no longer works with the most recent Java version). You can still access it at http://www.achaea.com/game/oldnexus for now, should you need to.

Nexus' new URL is http://nexus.achaea.com! No need to rush out and change your bookmarks, client.achaea.com and play.achaea.com will continue to work now and in the future!

Climbing the Spire: The Warriors of Baelgrim


Unsheathe your swords: the time has come again to test your mettle and might against your fellow warriors! Cast your name to fight in a best-of-three, double elimination combat tournament to discover who amongst you shall be the Champion of Baelgrim! Entries are currently being accepted for placement in the first round, which will commence once a suitable number of warriors have come forth.

Once all opponents have been designated, the tournament will begin! Opponents have three months from the start of the round to fight their battles, and inform me of the results - the winner shall be the victor of two of three fights, and shall continue to fight within the Fortress of Baelgrim, and his opponent shall be shunted to the Red Square bracket. Defeat within the Red Square, and be eliminated from the tournament entirely.

The battles will continue until all but one has been eliminated, and one victor reigns supreme over his fellow combatants - The Champion of Baelgrim! Upon triumph, this top warrior will be afforded a prize of fifty credits, as well as receiving the recognition from superiors in the form of a cityfavour, and the coveted right to bear the title 'The Champion of Baelgrim'. The runner-up will receive twenty-five credits, and a cityfavour.

Fight, and fight well, Mhaldor!
