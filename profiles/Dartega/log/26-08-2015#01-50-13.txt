From   : Executioner Cresil Aristata
To     : The City of Mhaldor
Subject: A Script of Reflection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings Mhaldor.

I have come to put quill to parchment to inform you all that as of this day, a manuscript of preserved skin has been placed at 'A pair of confessionals'.

This manuscript is designed to record the weaknesses and strengths of your citymates. Understand that in doing so, you are expected to remain professional whether you are scribing an opinionated weakness  for an ally, or reading what your peers may think of your own weaknesses. Entries may be anonymous or signed.

When adding an entry, be sure to follow the standardized format already provided. If the individual you wish to enlighten with your encouragement for purging their weakness is not on the list, simply add them to the first page, a Table of Contents of sorts, and then refer to that page in the manuscript to record your experiences.

Once again, this manuscript is designed for reflection upon ones self. This is not a writing post for your ill-tempered anger towards a colleague due to anonymity. Leave helpful words of encouragement that your target may grow in Strength and Suffering by your words, and purge said weakness from their form be it phsyical, mental or spiritual. Should you have any questions, please bring them to my attention.

Grow in Strength and Suffering, Mhaldor. Your peers are always judging you, as is the Master. Learn what they truly think of your weakness, and grow.

                               In Suffering

From   : Tyrannus Xinna Dracrotalus, Dread Legate
To     : Everyone
Subject: Weakness
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail Mhaldor,

While it is always appropriate to examine one's weaknesses, and those of others around yourself, there are proper channels for this and there are improper ones. If you have thoughts regarding new practices for Mhaldor to begin, it is best to inform your superiors of these ideas before going off on your own.

We will not have a manuscript described by the previous news post, as there is little purpose in it other than inflating one's own ego and attempting to subtly demean the reputations of colleagues. It has thus been removed and shall not be replaced.

In the future, consult the Council first.

In His service,

Xinna Dracrotalus
Tyrannus
Dread Legate

Penned by my hand on the 5th of Daedalan, in the year 692 AF.
