Subject: A Legacy of Ruin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Causing havoc and panic within the northern state, Golgotha's siege continued, his booming laugh echoed across the city as he unleashed wave after wave of minion, fiend, and beast against the Ashtani collaborators. The horrifying form of the Spawn of the Unnamable Horror remained amongst the Emperor's arsenal. Tearing the mansions upon Palace hill to rubble, the child of Chaos laid careless waste to the bolthole of the Shadowsnakes before turning its gaze upon the population.

It was with a profound unease that the Demiurge and Guardian gave their assent to Glaaki's plan, and not without good reason. With those nods one House sacrificed their greatest resource and the other agreed to undo the bindings that gave the Warlocks of the Rising Phoenix their very purpose. But agree they both did, for much more was at stake.

After months of hurried preparation, Mayan soon arrived, and brought with it Ashtan's chance to break the siege of the Emperor Golgotha. Overseer Dunn Lichlord gathered the eager citizenry and spoke of previous obstacles overcome and of his continued faith in the dominance of the Bastion. As his final words trailed off, the Occultists made quick way to their hidden halls. What went on behind the firmly locked doors may only be guessed at, but they soon emerged, bearing dour expressions, and with the Living Book of Eschaton in tow, the solemn scholars made their way to wait in the centre of Lake Balaton.

With the Eschaton and Arditi Ixodes in position, the Warlocks commenced their final blood oath, each of the gathered lighting for the last time one of the warding lanterns. When the cavern heavens gleamed with the multitude of promises and pacts, Guardian Ryldagh Valeth extinguished every lantern ever lit, plunging the sacred space into darkness and releasing the Phoenix beneath from its sustained slumber.

Quakes wracked the Bastion as the legendary bird awoke, a spark of recognition gleamed in its golden eyes as it sensed the amassed power of the Eschaton overhead. After screaming a challenging cry of long-repressed fury the creature tore its way through the earth, through the foundations of the Warlock estate before emerging abruptly, in a violent eruption of magma and shattered obsidian, a swirling mass of fire and smoke and steam to alight amidst the boiling lake.

A cloud of steam hovered over the city as the lava roiling in the wake of the Phoenix's path blasted the lake to cloudform, and melted the surroundings, including the monastery atop Cyclade hill, to a charred slag. Staunch in their duty to Ashtan, the gathered Ashura could only watch from their post readied at the gates, fists clenched as their ancient home slumped into the torrid and bubbling field.

Following fleet feet, the Eschaton was led through the streets towards the Chaos Plane portal waiting at the city gates, an undeniable bait for the Phoenix that followed in tow. Upon reaching its destination, the Occult legacy was summarily consumed, and the great bird turned its attention to the mire of Chaos beyond the humming portal, quickly diving through with a screeched challenge.

The loss of the Living Book of Eschaton, consumed by the Phoenix, preceded the failure of the protective wards about the Occultists' home, and with a quiet rumble the hidden estate collapsed in upon itself.

Lead by their Warlord, Jhui Ta'sa, the army of Ashtan mustered to breach the Chaos Plane and face what waited beyond...

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Summary: As the City of Ashtan crumbled before the siege of Emperor Golgotha, a last ditch and plainly foolish effort was made to muster an offence, sacrificing the remaining Houses, the Eschaton, and releasing the long guarded Phoenix in the process.

Subject: The Ascension of Glaaki
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The Unnamable Horror's Spawn took almost four hundred Ashtani deaths in turn before it eventually fell to the relentless onslaught. As the army gathered themselves, tended to their wounds, and raised their dead, the mocking laugh of the Emperor echoed across the Wheel of Chaos, his slowly clapped applause resounded like thunderclaps.

The derisive tones of Jy'Barrak Golgotha reached every man and woman upon the Chaos plane that day. "You think you can best the Horror's child? Here, upon the Plane of Chaos? It shall return, more powerful than you could possibly imagine."

Striking out alone, Glaaki began an ascent of the volcano, trudging through the barraging onslaught of Golgotha who sat upon his throne at the summit.

Great ruby bolts of thrown power staggered the step of the ascending Lord and a hideous spectral assault drew a scream from the cloaked form. Slowed but undaunted by the assault and the continued taunts of the Emperor, Glaaki continued walking. It was only a pale mist of blue that threatened his progress, the great cloud ensnaring the Eldritch figure.

The gathered Ashtani witnessed their hope diminish some heartbeats before an agonised scream was permitted to escape the aeonic disruption. With torturous clarity Golgotha subjected Glaaki to the promise of another eternity imprisoned outside of time. Through his mastery of the aural spectrum, with a pulsating expulsion of a violet hue, the Eldritch Lord tore himself free of the cruel device.

A low murmur of considered consternation rumbled across the plane as Golgotha's foe finally reached the entryway before the Infernal Throne. With a dramatic billow, the arrived Chaos Lord flung back his cloak to reveal his churning, tentacled form.

Glaaki's calm tones were clear to all, most of all the seated Emperor, "It has taken me an eternity, Golgotha, to reach this point. But despite the tortures of the Infernal Lords I have always held onto one thing."

With slow deliberation, Glaaki raised one hand, his clawed fingers clenched to a tight, white-knuckled fist, and uttered a single quiet word.

In immediate, violent response Golgotha fell from his throne with a thud that shook the furthest reaches of the plane. Black blood poured from his mouth, nose, ears, and eyes as his truename rooted him to the churning earth of the Wheel of Chaos.

Calculated victory was writ clear upon Glaaki's lined face as he unleashed the weapon he had hoarded since the two Lords were newborn thralls locked in competition and a childhood spent fighting for survival.

Twice more Glaaki spoke the incomprehensible and horrific utterance that resonated through Jy'Barrak Golgotha's person, mercilessly stripping away defence and protection layer by layer until the eminent Emperor knelt, small, weak, and trembling before the tentacle-wreathed Chaos Lord.

In the silence that followed, Imperator Glaaki, the Eldritch Ascendant took his seat for the first time upon the Infernal Throne.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Summary: After breaking through Golgotha's defences, the Ashtani army defeated the Spawn of the Unnamable Horror at great cost to themselves, enabling the downfall of Golgotha, and witnessing Imperator Glaaki, the Eldritch Ascendant take his seat upon the Infernal Throne.

Subject: Sarapin Sacrifices, and Unsundered Strength
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To mark the beginning of the Unsundered Strength tournament, a traditional Sarapin Sacrifice was held. Those gathered gave their lives, and prayers, unto His Malevolent Glory. Rather than adhering to the standard practice of one individual bringing death to the crowd, the audience was provided with the means to adhere to the truest meaning of the word 'sacrifice'.

It is only through the selfless and unyielding offering of ourselves to Evil by our own will that we may attain true Strength, and achieve Greatness.


Xinna has opened her own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Through our sacrifice, may we rise above the masses. Hail Lord Sartan!", in her final moments.
Jarrod has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Our lives devoted, strengthened through Suffering, the Master's army cannot be stopped", in his final moments.
Ziyth has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "May You accept this sacrifice as a token of my devotion.", in his final moments.
Medi has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Lord and Master, I am faithfully your eternal servant!", in his final moments.
Vivessa has opened her own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Only through hardships shall weakness be eliminated.", in her final moments.
Kitiara has opened her own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "My body is His body and I give it up willingly for Him. Hail my Master, Lord Sartan", in her final moments.
Saibel has opened her own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Ever your servant in Evil, Master Sartan.", in her final moments.
Mathonwy has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "True freedom is the freedom from weakness. This alone your City offers, LORD", in his final moments.
Ainly has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "For centuries have I served thee oh Lord, and still my faith remains as ardent as ever.", in his final moments.
Calaurn has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "The enemies of strength will be brought before you, Master.", in his final moments.
Watchman has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "The kingdom of our LORD is come nigh unto you.", in his final moments.
Herose has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "The LORD has revealed the path for this world. Embrace it!", in his final moments.
Aegoth has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Only the LORD rules this realm. For you, oh LORD, I give my life!", in his final moments.
Sydyk has opened his own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "Strength in Suffering. Hail Lord Sartan!", in his final moments.
Taraus has opened her own throat with a sacrificial blade gasping out, "And in that day, atrocity shall overtake the world and all shall walk in fear. Hail Lord Sartan!", in her final moments.


Details of the tournament can be found in Project 467. Questions can be directed to me.

Subject: Globes of Shifting Continents
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As promised, the refresh of our Globes of Shifting Continents is now live! We've got some fun new additions to the mix, alongside the usual artefacts, credits, reincarnations, trait resets, and much more! Here's the details of the new additions:

* Two new minipets! Your chance to pick up a graceful ocelot or a pygmy hippo (yes, he's as adorable as he sounds!)

* Room credits are now a prize possibility! There's never been a better time to start or expand your manor!

* Two different types of potted plants. These are fun little items that provide entertainment to their owner and guests! You may get a potted lycopod sapling, which is every bit as prickly as their larger siblings, or a potted corpse flower plant, whose blooms have a very distinctive scent. These items come in horticulturist's crate, allowing  them to be traded between players, and binding to them once removed. When dropped in the owner's house or ship cabin, they'll reset there until picked up (in which case, they'll reset to the owner's inventory).

Additionally, we've randomised the talisman pieces contained within the globes, adding in some pieces from prior events and promotions! Try your luck and you might find pieces from talismans in the Azatlan, Historical, and Marks sets.

We hope you enjoy these fun new items! Head over to http://www.achaea.com/credits to pick up your Globes today!

Subject: Lockets and "immortality"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since there seems to be some confusion about the immortality power, this is just a quick clarification post about it!

It's not true "immortality", more of a slight postponement of the inevitable. Here's what happens with the immortality power active:
   1. You receive a non-instakill attack that brings you to 0 health.
   2. The ability fires, giving you and people in the room a message that it fires.
   3. Your health is set to a very low level, any afflictions and effects on your person remain.
   4. You continue the fight as normal until either:
      a) Receive an attack that brings you to 0 health again.
      b) You get instakilled.
      c) The immortality power fails.
      d) You heal up to full health/mana (with a level 20 locket only).

This goes for both Mining and Soldier squads, and the level-based specializations and bonuses for mining squads have been doubled per level, to compensate.

As promised, the refresh of our Globes of Shifting Continents is now live! We've got some fun new additions to the mix, alongside the usual artefacts, credits, reincarnations, trait resets, and much more! Here's the details of the new additions:

* Two new minipets! Your chance to pick up a graceful ocelot or a pygmy hippo (yes, he's as adorable as he sounds!)

* Room credits are now a prize possibility! There's never been a better time to start or expand your manor!

* Two different types of potted plants. These are fun little items that provide entertainment to their owner and guests! You may get a potted lycopod sapling, which is every bit as prickly as their larger siblings, or a potted corpse flower plant, whose blooms have a very distinctive scent. These items come in horticulturist's crate, allowing  them to be traded between players, and binding to them once removed. When dropped in the owner's house or ship cabin, they'll reset there until picked up (in which case, they'll reset to the owner's inventory).

Additionally, we've randomised the talisman pieces contained within the globes, adding in some pieces from prior events and promotions! Try your luck and you might find pieces from talismans in the Azatlan, Historical, and Marks sets.

We hope you enjoy these fun new items! Head over to http://www.achaea.com/credits to pick up your Globes today!

19.10.4 Stats Altering Artefacts

(see also HELP ARTEFACTS, HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS, HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for
the owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone
else's inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell
them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.

There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground.
