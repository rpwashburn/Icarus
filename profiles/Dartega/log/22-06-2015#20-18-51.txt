Subject: Battlerage Update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each class and dragon colour has received a new Battlerage ability that allows you to break a denizen's shield. This ability has a relatively low rage cost and no cooldown.

The levels at which you earn new Battlerage abilities have been changed. They are now:

 Level 6:  Low damage ability
 Level 10: First affliction ability
 Level 20: Shield breaker ability
 Level 35: High damage ability
 Level 50: Conditional damage ability
 Level 65: Second affliction ability

And a few bug fixes:

 - You should no longer see messages about afflictions wearing off on denizens when the affliction has already been consumed by a battlerage attack.

 - Amnesia should now be properly cleared off of a denizen when it dies.

 - Battlerage Recovery should no longer increase infamy.

 - Battlerage Incense and Torment should now require that your guardian angel be visible.

Subject: Artefact shopping cart - item upgrades
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've just added a new feature to our current artefact cart promotion! You can now buy upgrade credit towards increasing the level of a multi-level artefact! These cart items are in 50cr lots, so if your intended artefact upgrade is 200cr, you'll need to buy 4 of them to completely cover the upgrade.

These upgrade credits are applied automatically when using the ARTEFACT <item> UPGRADE command. It will use these before any regular bound credits (which will be used if the upgrade cost is higher than the amount of "upgrade credits" you have).

** Note: These "upgrade credits" are only able to be used for artefact upgrades, and can not be converted into regular credits or lessons. They can not be transferred between players, nor can they be used to upgrade another player's artefacts.

Subject: We Should Have Eloped
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It began, as these things often do, with the quest for a perfect ring. Leaving his shop in the capable paws of his hound, Daveed left New Thera in search of a band worthy of his love. His quest was rewarded when he encountered Elstan Vorondil, a goldsmith of great talent who designed a ring that perfectly captured Daveed's beloved. Thanking him profusely for his aid and offering an invitation to the event in return, the shopkeeper returned home, content with his day's work.

Some months after that, Nissa, the head Archivist of the Lucretian Athenaeum could be found on a shopping expedition of her own. She first travelled to Ashtan but found little help there as the citizens she encountered were almost wholly focused on battle. Growing frustrated, she ventured into the forest and the village of Eleusis. There she found willing help in the form of Shirszae Nynniaw, Grondson Rousseau, Raem Callahan, and Torrent Alighieri-Drac'kal. They guided the flustered archivist to the perfect outfit to wear on her wedding day and she made her way back home, packages in hand.

Our couple's happy story almost came to an end when shouting was heard offering glimpses of an argument that threatened to ruin their love story. Adventurers quickly came to their aid, brokering a peace and then aiding them in the many tasks required to prepare for the happy event. Of great assistance to the lovebirds were Jinsun Ze'Dekiah, who provided various substances and words of wisdom to calm the nervous groom, and Emissary Indra who aided the bride in crafting the perfect vows. Not to be forgotten is the aid rendered by Lilio Candidior and Hexan d'Nox who tirelessly delivered the couple's invitations. Lilio's silver tongue proved especially useful in convincing recalcitrant guests. Anthony, a new resident who is opening a wedding boutique in New Thera, provided decorations and other festive accoutrements for the guests.

In the end, the wedding was a rousing success and the happy couple has settled into a state of wedded bliss.

               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Summary: Daveed and Nissa of New Thera received help from many adventurers as they planned and executed their wedding and Anthony of the Serendipity Boutique took the opportunity to announce the opening of his shop in the village.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mhaldor,

I am not one for many words, nor do I post to the boards often. Unfortunately, I have no choice but to do so now.

I must leave you Mhaldor, though this is no easy decision. For many years, I have worked tirelessly on my skills as a Blademaster. I have done my best to emulate Lucaine Pyramides and his ways to the best of my abilities. Sometimes I have fallen short, and sometimes I have conquered. Each misstep giving me the Strength to take the right one. Through Mhaldor, and His chosen, I felt that I was doing what was meant for me in this world. I have never questioned that, until now.

These last few months, my rest has been plagued with a dream. Starting out in small glimpses, it has grown into a full memory of sorts. As time has gone on, more and more of the dream has become clearer in my mind. I see trees, death, ashes...but no faces no voices. By the third night, I could smell the blood on the ground, the reek of burnt flesh almost as if I was standing there myself.

Each night it progressed in this manner, until it culminated into my most recent dream. As I sat in the glade of trees, writing some missive, I suddenly heard a rustle around me. Cursing at my falling so deeply into my writing, my senses return in a flash. My sword has gone. Quickly spinning around, I find that I am surrounded by many men. One standing in the center was a man I had recognized, though I did not know how. I still do not know how I recognized the man.

He spoke to me, in a language that I did not understand, yet I heard every word as if my understanding of language had transcended all natural boundaries. He had come to kill me, and had taken my blade in my moment of weakness. As I watched him draw the blade, my blade, from it's scabbard; I could not help but feel that this night would not be like any other. He stabbed my blade deeply into a tree, continually taunting me as he did, knowing I could not attack him surrounded as he was. When he applied pressure to the blade, and the snap of the metal rung through the air, everything went black.

I heard a voice, saying my name. "Atalkez", it said, "come to me." I could not see, nor feel yet I suddenly was face to face with a human I had never seen. Staring at me with his cold eyes, I felt the chill of the grave enter my bones. Every moment seeming like an eternity, I silently begged for him to speak, to break the silence. His face never moved, nor his mouth, yet his voice rung deep inside my head. "I have watched you, Atalkez. I have watched your rise as you have worked tirelessly to improve. However, you lie to yourself, Atalkez. You lie to the world."

The voice faded once more, as I seemingly floated in the void, my consciousness racing as I wondered if this was a dream. It seemed so real, everything felt so vivid. The man begin to warp and change, his sun-tanned skin becoming blackened as if by flames. The voice, originally a soft timbre, now ragged and cracking. ?You must find yourself, Atalkez. The way of the Blade was not meant for this. Find purpose in your actions, more than slaughter. Find this purpose before you become like me, Atalkez. My love was too late, a river dried before it reached the lake. Will you be the same??

As the voice faded from my mind, I found myself sitting in the Glade of Frozen Trees. I could not remember how I got there, nor how long I had been there. As I walked back to Mhaldor, my mind begin to put the pieces together. I know now, Lucaine Pyramides has challenged me. I accept his challenge, and must find this purpose he believes that I have. I will find this path, whatever it should take. I will not fail.

Thank you Mhaldor, for the Strength to make this decision. Thank you for the Strength to move forward alone.

I hope this path returns me to His service.

In Strength,

Atalkez Al'Jafri

Subject: The Families of Mhaldor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brethren,

The passing of Chronos 685 saw the Lichlord family hosting their annual event, a lovely dinner cruise upon the shores of the Baarian Bay. The next scheduled to host an affair will be the illustrious Dracrotalus family, in the autumn of 689.

That will end the previous roster of major families, at which point I'll be introduce a new practice - to leave the calendar open afterwards for an open event. This will provide an opportunity for either a minor Mhaldorian family, or a burgeoning bloodline, to host an event of their own, to generate awareness of their name, and their maxims.

Those wishing to take advantage of this opportunity have until Ero 690 to let me know of their desire to host such a fete, and an approximate scope of the size and nature of the affair. Should this prove to be a successful practice, then it will be formally added to the calendar of events, to be recognised at the end of every cycle. Bear in mind, this will only be sanctioned by the ministry if the family is, in fact, rooted and based in Mhaldor.

After this, the rotation will begin once more, with activities hosted by the Nithilar dynasty.

To correct an error printed previously, the correct order of circulation is:
House Nithilar, House Aristata, House Lichlord, House Dracrotalus.


I look forward to hearing from our established and esteemed families, and new generations, alike.

Subject: Greatness and Favour: An Unhappy Union?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greatness is a choice.
 
Axiomatic but too often ignored, without choice the Seven Truths of Evil would be unrecognizable: stars lost at high noon. Mhaldorian society celebrates greatness as representing the highest aspiration of mortalkind. In each other, we see not only our inborn capacity to choose - but our shared, yet fundamentally personal, struggle to choose rightly.
 
Discerning right from wrong is a topic for another essay. What follows is a discussion on the relationship between greatness and favour. We address ourselves at the outset to that most visible expression of civic pride: the Mhaldorian cityfavour.
 
The favours of Mhaldor, like the greatness for which they are given, are fruits of discipline and sacrifice, free to all whom would reach higher. Though varied as the scars what mark our backs, the favours of Mhaldor share one commonality: permanence at odds with everything we know to be true about the fluid nature of greatness. This discrepancy between static favour and fluid greatness carries serious implications. Chief among them are the consequences attaching to city rank, a static measure of aggregate favour.
 
Rank equates to authority, conferring the privileges, responsibilities, and expectations that we associate with greatness. But as we have established, greatness lives and dies in right choosing and right action; it exists in the moment. If greatness past is an inaccurate predictor of greatness present, what is the proper role of city rank, if any, in a society based on truth and true measures? Greatness is fluid; should rank be more fluid, also?
 
The daemons, as they say, are in the details.
 
Decisions to willingly forego privileges, responsibilities, and expectations associated with rank meet with general confusion and disappointment. Once a capacity for greatness has been demonstrated, expectations are that it will continue to be exercised and expanded upon, indefinitely. But is this expectation justified by experience? To ask the question is to know the answer.
 
By way of example, every society has witnessed careers that might best be described as meteoric; greatness that flares from existence after a single, incandescent season. Is it the defiance of namelessness that brings these celestial beings into orbit? How tragic then that anonymity can yield to fame but once.
 
Others arguably find themselves victims of the Petra Principle, and only cease to be promoted once they can no longer perform effectively. Having risen beyond their scope of competence, these unhappy tenures rarely last (but too often do), ending in responsible resignation or a craven half-life tantamount to dormancy. This happenstance is too commonplace to shock us now, if it ever did. But is it fair to reserve our disappointment for them we promote in the first place?
 
Perhaps the cleverest means of managing expectations is avoidance. Individuals practicing this strategy know who they are. By studiously avoiding favour (and responsibility and expectations), they live among us as Plebians in black clothes.
 
To simply plateau is a lesser variant of the same conceit: a retirement from pain, then discipline, upon achieving some success in a single or related fields of endeavour. These individuals may feel that they have demonstrated greatness enough in arriving where they are. But is this the lesson to be gleaned from success?
 
The foregoing demonstrates some of the problems inherent in linking the expectations of greatness with rank. But what can be done to bring expectations in line with reality? Mhaldorians of conscience, and I use that word with reluctance, have over the years devised means of reconciling this problem, some more radical than others. Let us close this discussion by introducing two solutions from opposite ends of the spectrum.
 
The first and less controversial of these solutions amounts to an expansion of existing practice: voluntary demotion as self-sacrifice. Standardizing this practice could discourage such demotions from being perceived as an unseemly exercise in public self-flagellation. A more provocative solution might usher in the quinquennial demotion of all citizens, a current against which all must continue swimming.
 
Many will remain unconvinced that our system of rank and privilege needs changing. It can be argued that fluidity necessarily undermines stability, the bedrock status quo. But please ask yourself, reader, what principle is being served by stability: tradition or comfort?

Hail Mhaldor,

As I continue my efforts as your Librarian I noticed that our only books on Mhaldorian sermons and rituals are very outdated and so I call for a new project in which I am in need of 2-3 more volunteers.

I need researchers to help me sift through the news posts and scattered notes to try and gather more recent sermons and rituals of our great city to make a second volume. With that said, if anyone has personal copies of anything over the last 200 years or so please let me know and if possible submit a copy to me so we may add it to this new volume.

Thank you in advance and I look forward to hearing from those looking for volunteer work.

Legates,

Turn your efforts towards expanding His influence and crushing the influence of others.

As an incentive, beginning immediately and continuing for a period two (2) years until the serenade on Lupar 688 the Dread Legates will be granting rewards to those who prove most prolific in this endeavor.

Every 130,000 essence offered to the Master will yield one (1) point.

Providing all of the corpses necessary to raise and fully sanctify a shrine will yield three (3) points.  Inquire first with a Sartai to determine if there are shrines to be raised and there is a Sartai capable of raising it.  To be awarded points the Sartai who raised the shrine -must- either message me and indicate that you provided all the corpses or notate it on the logs. You are responsible to ensure that this is completed as no points will be awarded if there is no corresponding note or message from the
Sartai.

Providing all of the corpses necessary and utilizing them to destroy any heathen shrine will yield three (3) points.  Utilize CHELP ENEMYSHRINES to aide you in finding heathen shrines. If you find a shrine not noted in that scroll notify myself or one of the Council of Mhaldor.  As per the current standing orders do not defile shrines  of the Order of Phaestus.  You must have either a full Dread Legate or Dynamis message me or notate on the logs the:  area the shrine was located in, the Order of the shrine, and who,
alone, provided the corpses to destroy the shrine.

Five (5) credits will be provided for every 15 points for non-Dragons and 21 points for Dragons.

In addition, the most prolific Legate will be awarded two (2) housefavours while the next most prolific will be awarded one (1) housefavour.

All will kneel before the Master in time by choice ... or by force.

==========

Inside the Mausoleum of Ekary Lucoster (indoors).
The small iron port and the massive wooden door meant to seal the building off have
been vandalised and hang from their hinges, locks broken. From the light pouring in
through the open door, one can see a massive sarcophagus resting on an incline at the
far end of the room. The lid of it is very thick glass with no apparent openings.
Tool marks reveal unsuccessful attempts to open it. Under the glass rests the final
remains of a decayed body, dressed in formal robes of the finest quality. In the
skeleton's hand is gripped an ornate sword of translucent amber, with the holy symbol
of Sartan engraved in the pommel. An epitaph on the wall reads: "Ekary Lucoster,
called "the Sinistar" since childhood, lies here in his final resting place. His
outstanding work forming the knightly brotherhood of the Infernals, his passion for
his city, his family and Achaea, will always be remembered." Metal and stone icons of
Sartan, Eris, Lupus, Aegis, and Twilight watch over the crypt from small alcoves in
the walls. Intricate mosaics of coloured stone line the walls and floor, with scenes
depicting epic battles and gods looking on in amusement from high places.  The Golden
Dragon Aepas' imposing form looms. Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here. She
wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand. Lord Watchman
Dracrotalus, Crusher is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a
vorpal sword in his right. With dignified poise, Karmic Scholar Reiloch loafs about.
Dread Duelist Cesarina is here, shrouded. She wields Thoth's fang in her left hand
and a lightweight buckler in her right. Dread Emissary Uzu, Thrall of Ruth is here.
Taraus Bravi'os is here. Ainly Sar'vet, Magna Araneae is here. He wields a banded
shield in his left hand. Staring into space, Flamebrand Recruit Ula is barely here.
Her face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. She wields an ornate fishing
pole in both hands. Eminence Saeva Aristata, Lady Feral is here. She wields a
blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in her right hand.

There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 2 monolith sigils in 2 groups here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A light horse lingers here, pawing at the ground. The soft hush of rolling tides surrounds a seafoam nytrow, enmity burning in his gleaming red eye.  Fiend Mathonwy Corso, the Foolish is here.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Muscles rippling beneath his grey coat, a noble destrier stands tall here, mane draped over his long neck.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
You see exits leading east, south, west, and up.
