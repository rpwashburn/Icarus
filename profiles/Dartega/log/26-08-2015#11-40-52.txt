A massive gatehouse (indoors).
This enormous gatehouse is carved directly into the side of the mountain. Jagged stone walls reflect what little light is projected from the torches set between each archer slit. Racks holding weapons and several large, stone shelves filled with arrows line the eastern side of the room. Broken, discarded weapons are strewn across the floor, as though they were tossed there with great haste. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 4 monolith sigils in 4 groups here. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Observing from high above the ground is a reticulated giraffe. A crystalline golem stands here. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground.  Mathonwy I'llur, Vindicator of Faith is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right.
You see a single exit leading west.
