A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. There are 3 aurum flakes in a group here. A lustrous silver flake of antimony lies abandoned here. There are 3 magnesium chips in a group here. Looking ready for anything, a hulking war elephant stands here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose.  Legate Medi is here, his head bowed. He wields a cavalry shield in his left hand and a morning star in his right.
You see a single exit leading west.

From   : Druid Athelas

Subject: 100,000 gold Reward
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I Druid Athelas, am now personally offering 100,000 (one-hundred-thousand) gold sovereigns, to anyone capable of lifting the blight currently plaguing the gardens and trees surrounding Creville Asylum.

To claim this bounty you have to:

1. Cause the blight to be lived for a period of no less than two years.

2. Provide any and all information regarding how this was achieved, in minutest detail, to myself and the current leadership of Eleusis.

3. Allow me and any I deem fit, to observe you as you perform any tasks required to effect this change.

4. The tasks you perform may not harm any natural environment in any way for any amount of time.

The bounty is immediately available. Held in escrow at the Eleusian Bank of Commerce.

A further 50,000 (fifty-thousand) gold sovereigns is offered, should you be able to prove positive evidence of what caused said blight.

Your identity will be held in the strictest confidence, should you require such.

That is all,
  Druid Athelas.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dearest Athelas,

I know you do not know me, as most of you do not and that is fine. But be leery when attempting to meddle with Creville, there is no telling what spawn might be drawn forth from your attempts to cure something that you, as you already seemed to have shown, know naught about. I currently have a home in Creville, and purchased it with the help of my husband because one can see beauty in the corrupt around their persons.

Oh, and do not meddle in the affairs of dragons.

That is all,

Signed,

Nieelensars

Dear Nieelensars,

The bounty stands.

I for one, knew Creville before the blight. It wasn't teeming with life, but it was alive.

Even if my last breath serves as payment for your lovely estate, to be surrounded by an equally lovely forest, I will see it so!

Should you know more of these "spawn" you mention, feel free to try and claim that bounty.

Respectfully,
  Druid Athelas.

Subject: Creville Blight bounty increase
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm glad to announce an increase on the bounty, for the resolution of the blight in Creville Asylum.

The bounty is now at 200,000 (two-hundred-thousand) gold.

If you've forgotten or simply can't be bothered to read the previous post on the subject, here are the conditions again:

To claim this bounty you have to:

1. Cause the blight to be lifted for a period of no less than four years. (The period here has increased due to the increased bounty)

2. Provide any and all information regarding how this was achieved, in minutest detail, to myself and the current leadership of Eleusis.

3. Allow me and any I deem fit, to observe you as you perform any tasks required to effect this change.

4. The tasks you perform may not harm any natural environment in any way for any amount of time.

Again, the bounty is immediately available. Held in escrow at the Eleusian Bank of Commerce.

And once more: A further 50,000 (fifty-thousand) gold sovereigns is offered, should you be able to prove positive evidence of what caused said blight.

Your identity will be held in the strictest confidence, should you require such.

This offer is open to any and all sentient beings.

Yes Wlor, I'm looking at you, I've been using a lot of stick on you so here's a carrot. Take it and go retire in a nice villa somewhere.

Respectfully,
  Druid Athelas.

Subject: Battlerage Config Settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've separated Battlerage notifications into three different categories to allow you more fine-gained control over the messages you do and don't want to see.

The three categories are:

   GAIN
    - Notifications about generating and losing rage.

   ABCOOLDOWNS
    - Notifications about the cooldown of a specific ability.

   GLOBALCOOLDOWNS
    - Notifications about the global 1-second cooldown on all Battlerage
      abilities.

Use CONFIG RAGEMSG <options> to control these configuration settings.

Examples:

   CONFIG RAGEMSG
    - Turns off all three categories of notifications.

   CONFIG RAGEMSG GAIN
    - Turns gain notifications on, and all cooldown notifications off.

   CONFIG RAGEMSG GAIN ABCOOLDOWNS
    - Turns notifications about rage gain and specific ability cooldowns on,
      but global cooldown notifications are off.

Subject: New version of the client to test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There's a yet-newer version of the client at newclient.achaea.com that includes some new functionality:

 * There's now a 'you' window by default in the lower left-hand corner. It'll show you, graphically:
     * when your limbs get messed up
     * when you're shielded
     * when 15 common defenses are activated
     * your current bleeding
     * your current Rage
     * Somewhere between 0 and 2 other relevant stats, depending on your class.

 * The window also shows a text list of all afflictions and defences. It'll show both lists simultaneously if the window is big enough, otherwise will default to showing afflictions, though you can click to switch between the two.

* There are now 7 f-keys by default, and what they're auto-populated with has changed.
     * In particular, as you level up and get your Battlerage abilities, the client will autofill BR abilities into there. You are, of course, free to overwrite them.

Subject: Plagued upon Sand and Sea
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Years of planning had finally come to fruition, and the city of Caspia was abuzz over the preparations. If Borak could be released by the landwalkers, then the Cult would be one step closer to unseating the imposter and that is one step closer to the rebirth of the rightful King of the Oceans.

Untold swathes of the populous had been committed to the fanatics who propagated the plague, cycles of infection tested upon their own before the sargassum were deemed complete and suitable for the task. These great carpets of virulence were then transported beneath the shroud of liquid night, across war lines and past land to be secured in the far depths of various oceans.

It began with the interception of a raiding party returning home. Buoyant in victory, the members of the Umbrinite skiff could not have prepared for the living death that broached their vessel as intended by the tritons. Three survived, as intended, and returned to their island fortress. The bravest amongst them attempted to explain, but no traction for horror stories was found amidst the order of the Umbrinite military. Passed off as the ravings of an undisciplined soldier, the tale was soon forgotten. When the raiders eventually succumbed to the plague, their bodies were given to the sea.

Strategic positioning and base curiosity saw the infection spread across the lands; the harbours of Sapience either closed or were hubs for the debilitating disease, and few ships that braved the oceans escaped this time with no losses. Obtaining the cure required ships manned by the already sick, or the infection of fresh crews, each appearance of the sargassum was a blessed nightmare for all afloat.

Until they ceased rising.

Silent seas lasted for months, the curative candles stored soon dwindled, and quiet discussions were had about putting the torch to the harbours en masse. These conditions were deemed perfect by the strategist Agiads- the heathen forces were near breaking now. It was not another sargassum which next broke the cold quiescence of the waters, but the call to arms of a warhorn. The undead laid seige to the land.

               ~ ~ ~

Ceaselessly, and for months, did the animated cadaver army of Caspia throw itself upon the shores. The sodden grip of the dead hundreds as Achaeans fought against every step on the sun-baked sands. Captain Maelstrom of Tasur'ke offered rewards for those who risked their lives to protect the land of Sapience, and a great number heeded the call.

               ~ ~ ~

Another warhorn's bellow originating from far offshore signalled a termination of the attack and preceded the swift arrival of two Caspiite war citadels. Held in position off the eastern shoreline, those who ran to the coast to observe could just make out a tiny figure wearing a horned bronze helm standing behind the nose-cap of one of the whales.

The Agiad made the demands of Caspia known: "We give you one day, landwalkers. Return the bite to the northern ocean before we return."

Reiterating their centuries-old demand, the Caspiites sought to ransom their foothold upon the land to secure the release of Borak, Caspeid Guardian of the Northern Sea.

With no response made by the landwalkers, the day passed, and a great angered bellow was heard from the furthest reaches of the Eusian Ocean. Moving in an escort formation, two Caspiite war citadels were soon seen upon the eastern horizon, flanking the towering form of an oceanic cyclops. The bravest of Sapience's seafarers quickly boarded their ships to offer an appropriate greeting.

As the dreadful goliath approached the Tasur'ke shore, a great battle struck up, with the ships of countless factions engaging the would-be invaders, working to repulse the incursion. Masterfully handling their fearsome war citadels, the tritons played their role well, and despite the withering barrage laid down by the sailors of Sapience, the cyclops gained the beach.

Gravely injured by the combined might and valour of sailors from Mhaldor, Cyrene, Ashtan, Hashan, and Targossas the cyclops nonetheless roared with renewed vigour, and prepared to wreak havoc upon the insignificant settlements of the coast. Even so the goliath swatted at the awaiting force as if they were no more than insects. But if they were insects, it was a swarm, and the weakened cyclops, this weapon of Caspia, soon fell to the ground with a thud.

As the towering form of the cyclops collapsed in defeat, the citadels briskly turned towards the Cnidian Gates, and fled, thoroughly routed. Pursued by numerous vessels, chief among them the windcutter Eslofe, the tritons did not evade retribution, as one of their citadels capsized, its shell shattered and ruined under the relentless bombardment. The other finally limped into the maze of the Cnidian gates, eluding the pursuit
of the vengeful seafarers.

In the battle's wake, a derelict tangle of hemic sargassum, now devoid of its virulent cargo, ran aground upon the Tasur'ke beach.

Subject: A Trial Ended by Fire
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A sombre mood hung over the deck of the TLS Inexorable as the hulking Seastrider entered the Cnidian Gates. Obeying an urgent charge from the Baarian Apocathery, Yabbahar, their destination hung upon the distant northern horizon - the Isle of Umbrin, the first harbour to become infected with the plague which had ravaged the seas over the past year. Yabbahar's expectations had been bleak, as had his predictions of trouble on the route.

True to Yabbahar's assessment, the mighty ship clashed with a Caspiite war citadel before long, trading volleys of ammunition for merciless battering assaults from the enraged behemoth towing the citadel. Finally eluding the creature after fighting it to a standstill on more than one occasion, TLS Inexorable converged on Umbrin, patrolling east and west as the sailors decided on their approach. Eventually docking at the harbour, they disembarked briskly, eager to purge the harbour of the contagion. As Watchman lit the vat which Yabbahar had entrusted to him, the seafarers struck up conversation with a quarantine official, learning that the quarantine would be lifted as soon as curative had taken hold at the harbour.

Finally gaining access to Umbrin, the fortitude of the intrepid Mhaldorians was sorely tested as they encountered a mass grave on the ordered, regular streets of Umbrin. The island was a grisly tableau of misery and contagion. As Saeva stepped into the highest room of the Grand Academy, General Boracin spat out a reproach, lamenting the callous ignorance showed by the inhabitants of the mainland in quarantining the island: a sentence of agony, pestilence, and death for his people. This done, he expired, and his towering form, haggard and ravaged by the disease, slumped to the ground. Elsewhere, the explorers discovered Umbrinites who had opted to escape the pain of the plague, and others who had drawn their weapons in defiant scorn of their impending demise.

Returning to the continent, Watchman relayed the grave news to Yabbahar. It was rapidly agreed that the corpses would need to be burned, and Yabbahar next produced the product of his months studying the plague: four globes full of concentrated sargassum. Handing these over to Watchman, Sunny, Ginovianna, and Valkyn, he directed the captains to gather the plague corpses into pyres, and to immolate them along with the globes. Danger attended the ships as they made the crossing to Umbrin, as intense battles broke out with Caspiite war citadels.

Some of those from the first mission to Umbrin applied themselves to the task at hand, and slung the plague corpses unceremoniously onto towering pyres across the island of Umbrin. As the first pyre was finally lit, with Watchman casting his globe into the burgeoning flames, a virulent plume of black smoke began to rise, forming a thick, miasmic smog overhead. As the other pyres were lit, the acrid cloud began to take its toll, prolonged exposure causing great pain and affliction among those on the island. With the fourth pyre lit, vicious tongues of fire searing the rigid Umbrinite corpses, the island quickly emptied once more.

After perhaps a month, the black smoke from the pyres abruptly turned to white as Yabbahar's globes were penetrated by the flames. The rising cloud, now a milky white, swiftly began to neutralise the black miasma girdling Umbrin. As the sky cleared, the pyres finally exhausted their supply of fuel and burned down, leaving behind the melted detritus of Yabbahar's globes. Quiet and subdued, the Umbrinites returned from the halls of Thoth, many among their number regarding with a baleful eye the mainland, whose inhabitants allowed them to die in their droves...

               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Summary:
With the Caspiite contagion purged from Umbrin, the quarantine on the Port has been lifted!

Subject: Debate in Regards to Hierarchy
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Curator Carmain Nithilar, Vindicator of Faith says, "The topic of today's debate will be."

Curator Carmain Nithilar, Vindicator of Faith says, "Regarding formal address in the city, as demanded by law: While necessary to establish the ranks of order and the chain of command at lower levels, does it become detrimental amongst colleagues and peers at higher ranks, by virtue of adding a sense of distance and formality, rather than comraderie?"

Curator Carmain Nithilar, Vindicator of Faith says, "If someone could record this to be posted to the Mhaldor newsboard, that would also be good."

Cesarina says, "If I could give a quick input I shall."

Curator Carmain Nithilar, Vindicator of Faith says, "You are all welcome to speak out."

Cesarina says, "I understand the necessity, especially for newer citizens to get used to the chain of command and how things work in our city, however... It almost seems a charade half the time."

Cesarina says, "You get close partnerships with citizens but have to address them properly and it makes me feel like my best allies are foreign strangers."

Cesarina says, "I always try to do so in front of new citizens, but honestly in private I never bother."

Cesarina says, "Hope that doesn't make me a scummy heathen."

Curator Carmain Nithilar, Vindicator of Faith says, "Does anyone else have anything to say on the matter?"

Legate Medi says, "I believe that it continues to add clarity and order, it reminds us all who was recognized for their combat knowledge and placed appropriately, and who we should ultimately listen to."

Carmain tilts his head curiously at Medi.

Kitiara says in Mhaldorian in a trenchant voice, "We lead by example if the younger slaves are to learn of hierarchy and chain of command it is important to be consistent. If you do not address properly how can you criticize when the younger do not."

Cesarina asks Kitiara, "But you agree outside of public channels and public discussion it's unnecessary?"

Legate Medi says, "Assuming both parties are comfortable with it."

Slowly lowering your knees to the ground, you sit upon your ankles.

Kitiara says to Cesarina in Mhaldorian in a trenchant voice, "Depends what your personal rapport is. Just because you are in private doesn't give the go ahead to drop titles."

When you regain consciousness, you are confused about where you are and how you got here. Darkness surrounds you, save for a single candle. A look around tells you that you are in a rough cave, with a single table bearing the candle.

A verdant clearing laden with cherry blossoms.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. A rune shaped like a butterfly has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like an open eye has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Petals falling from its flowering branches, a cherry blossom tree thrives here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A dyed gold poster bearing the title "Delivery Services!" has been hung here. An elegant white letter is in danger of being soiled here. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Resting on the ground is a cube-shaped silver sigil. Antlers of jet black crown the head of a proud ivory peryton. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper is here, shrouded. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her right hand. Legate Kisharo Aristata is here. Commandant Chiam Nithilar is here. Carbine Sar'vet, Initiate of the West is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a bard's mandolin in his left hand and a Soulpiercer in his right. The Golden Dragon Hasar's imposing form looms.

He wields a Logosian longsword in his left hand and a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his right. Minister Crixos Nithilar is riding on an ivory peryton.
