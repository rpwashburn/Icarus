Hunt (Apostasy)                               Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            DAEGGER LEVITATE
                   DAEGGER HUNT <target>
Works on/against:  Adventurers
Cooldown:          4.00 seconds of equilibrium
Details:
Your daegger has become stronger. Strong enough, in fact, that it can,
with a bit of help from you, levitate itself and even fly at potentially
lethal speeds towards your foe. This is superior to simply throwing the
weapon because it can hook around and come at odd angles, and if it
misses, it will attack again. Because you are guiding the daegger
largely with the power of your mind, your intelligence, not your
strength, affects the power with which it will strike your opponent.
Additionally, your weaponry skill is what affects the chance of it
hitting, as the daegger is putting most of its energy into the act of
levitation. The higher your skill in Apostasy is, the greater the number
of passes your daegger will make.

7.26 Hunting

       7.25 < Relics                                    Quivers > 7.27

Hunting the denizens of Achaea is one of the primary methods by which an
adventurer can gain experience and gold. The key to hunting effectively is to
find the most powerful denizens that you can safely kill, as those more
powerful denizens are worth more experience and have a chance to drop greater
quantities of gold.


Finding Appropriate Denizens
----------------------------
Vast hordes of denizens populate the world of Achaea. Most areas will contain
groups of denizens that share a common level range, allowing you to spend time
in a small area killing groups of denizens with similar difficulty. The
CONSIDER command can be extremely helpful in determining the relative strength
of a denizen, as well as giving you information about the current health level
of the denizen. HELP CONSIDER has more information about using the command to
view information about denizens.


Denizens Fight Back
-------------------
While you are attacking your chosen target, in almost all circumstances the
denizen will be hitting you in return. The denizens in Achaea use a series of
varied attacks which can range from damage to your health to various
debilitating afflictions. Make sure to come prepared with elixirs to heal you
and curatives to remove the afflictions. Read HELP CURES and HELP HEAL for more
information.

Some denizens are considered to be berserkers and will attack you as soon as
you enter their rooms.

Some groups of denizens will share loyalty with a common leader. In those
situations, when you strike one of the loyal denizens, all other denizens in
the room that share the same loyalty will also attack you in retaliation.

As you are involved in combat with a denizen, the more you hit the denizen and
take certain actions (like healing other adventurers), the more angry the

5846h, 6081m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-1000-s07:30:50.93--
[File continued via MORE]
denizen will become with you. The denizens use this anger level to determine
who they will hit when they attack. If you are the only adventurer involved in
combat with the denizen, then the denizen will have no choice but to strike
you. If you are attacking the denizen in a group with other adventurers. the
denizen will strike the target who has made the denizen the most angry. In most
cases, this will be the adventurer who has done the most damage.


Hunting in a Group
------------------
Hunting with other adventurers is frequently more efficient than hunting on
your own, particularly when the group is able to tackle stronger denizens than
you might be able to handle by yourself. When you are in a group with other
adventurers, the experience rewards from the death of a denizen will be
distributed amongst all of the members of the group. Higher-leveled adventurers
in the group will receive a greater share of the experience than lower-leveled
adventurers, but the overall pool of experience distributed will be higher than
if you had been hunting alone. Read HELP GROUPS for more information about
forming groups of
adventurers.

        6.3 < TREES                                      ALLIES > 6.5

A GROUP is a group of adventurers who are travelling in a cohesive unit.

How to Form a Group
-------------------
FOLLOW someone! For example, if you wish to follow Crotalus, you'd simply
FOLLOW CROTALUS and you'll be added to his group.


Benefits of Groups
------------------
You will generally share experience gained in combat while you are in a group.
A dedicated channel for speaking to members of your group exists: GROUPTELL, or
GT.


How to Leave a Group
--------------------
LOSE the person you are following (or is following you), or simply walk away
from the group.


How to See Who is in Your Group
-------------------------------
The GROUP command will show the person you're following, and all other members
of your group.

If you wish to see which of your loyal denizen companions are following you,
the ENTOURAGE (or ENT for short) command will give you the details.

Group Movement
--------------
If you follow another adventurer, then when he moves, you'll move too (assuming
you can).

(see also HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS and HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for
the owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone
else's inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell
them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.

     the other pair to some different partner at a later time, this can
     be accomplished. Cost: 100 credits. You specify the partner at
     purchase time with the following syntax:

Subject: Classleads: August 2015 - Part 3

Shindo

Weaponmastery
-------------
* (Two-handed) BRAIN has been added to the specialisation.
* (Two-handed) Lethargy will now be given when the strike that gives wrist fractures lands.
* (Dual Cutting) INTIMIDATE has been added to the specialisation.
* (Dual Cutting) CONCUSS has been added to the specialisation (battleaxes only)

Misc
----
* LOOKing at an adventurer will now indicate the presence of mining rare minerals, alongside runes and favours.

Subject: Legions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have changed Legions to be from levels 1-10 instead of 1-20, and you'll find that your Legions' levels have been cut in half (unless they were level 1), and if they were an odd level, they were set at halfway to the next level.

This goes for both Mining and Soldier squads, and the level-based specializations and bonuses for mining squads have been doubled per level, to compensate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As promised, the refresh of our Globes of Shifting Continents is now live! We've got some fun new additions to the mix, alongside the usual artefacts, credits, reincarnations, trait resets, and much more! Here's the details of the new additions:

* Two new minipets! Your chance to pick up a graceful ocelot or a pygmy hippo (yes, he's as adorable as he sounds!)

* Room credits are now a prize possibility! There's never been a better time to start or expand your manor!

* Two different types of potted plants. These are fun little items that provide entertainment to their owner and guests! You may get a potted lycopod sapling, which is every bit as prickly as their larger siblings, or a potted corpse flower plant, whose blooms have a very distinctive scent. These items come in horticulturist's crate, allowing  them to be traded between players, and binding to them once removed. When dropped in the owner's house or ship cabin, they'll reset there until picked up (in which case, they'll reset to the owner's inventory).

Additionally, we've randomised the talisman pieces contained within the globes, adding in some pieces from prior events and promotions! Try your luck and you might find pieces from talismans in the Azatlan, Historical, and Marks sets.

We hope you enjoy these fun new items! Head over to http://www.achaea.com/credits to pick up your Globes today!

Subject: Classleads: August 2015 - Part 3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And while we're putting in new things, here's the penultimate classlead batch from our August 2015 season! Without further ado, I present:

Elementalism
------------
* FIRELASH has been brought into line with other equilibrium-based abilities, and is not nullified by confusion.
* CAST FIRELASH <dir> has been added, allowing targeting of a specific icewall. The old syntax still works for lashing a wall in any direction.

Runelore
--------
* ISAZ has been rewritten, fixing up a slew of bugs and issues with the ability.
* ISAZ block rate has been slightly reduced, bringing it into parity with other hindering abilities.

Shindo
------
* BLIZZARD and THUNDERSTORM damage has been increased, and will now scale with the target's maximum health.

Weaponmastery
-------------
* (Two-handed) BRAIN has been added to the specialisation.
* (Two-handed) Lethargy will now be given when the strike that gives wrist fractures lands.
* (Dual Cutting) INTIMIDATE has been added to the specialisation.
* (Dual Cutting) CONCUSS has been added to the specialisation (battleaxes only)

Misc
----
* LOOKing at an adventurer will now indicate the presence of mining rare minerals, alongside runes and favours.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have changed Legions to be from levels 1-10 instead of 1-20, and you'll find that your Legions' levels have been cut in half (unless they were level 1), and if they were an odd level, they were set at halfway to the next level.

This goes for both Mining and Soldier squads, and the level-based specializations and bonuses for mining squads have been doubled per level, to compensate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As promised, the refresh of our Globes of Shifting Continents is now live! We've got some fun new additions to the mix, alongside the usual artefacts, credits, reincarnations, trait resets, and much more! Here's the details of the new additions:

* Two new minipets! Your chance to pick up a graceful ocelot or a pygmy hippo (yes, he's as adorable as he sounds!)

* Room credits are now a prize possibility! There's never been a better time to start or expand your manor!

* Two different types of potted plants. These are fun little items that provide entertainment to their owner and guests! You may get a potted lycopod sapling, which is every bit as prickly as their larger siblings, or a potted corpse flower plant, whose blooms have a very distinctive scent. These items come in horticulturist's crate, allowing  them to be traded between players, and binding to them once removed. When dropped in the owner's house or ship cabin, they'll reset there until picked up (in which case, they'll reset to the owner's inventory).

Additionally, we've randomised the talisman pieces contained within the globes, adding in some pieces from prior events and promotions! Try your luck and you might find pieces from talismans in the Azatlan, Historical, and Marks sets.

We hope you enjoy these fun new items! Head over to http://www.achaea.com/credits to pick up your Globes today!

5846h, 6071m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:01:52.18--
Ariocha, the Dreadlord explains to you that cold is largely in the mind, and not the body. With proper focus and enough training, she states, one can learn to become all but immune to even the most extreme cold.
5846h, 6081m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:01:57.18--
You are warned by Ariocha, the Dreadlord that to truly teach yourself to withstand the cold, you will have to immerse yourself in it. She recommends that you spend time on high mountains or out in snowstorms to capture the elements words cannot convey.

5846h, 6071m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:01.44--
Having said this, Ariocha, the Dreadlord begins to detail the techniques through which cold can be resisted. She tells you to focus on your heart, willing it to pump blood faster and more into your extremities. You try to follow her example, but feel no change.
5846h, 6061m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:05.18--
After a few moments, Ariocha, the Dreadlord shakes her head and reaches out to take hold of your wrist. You are surprised to find that her fingers are almost hot against your skin.
5846h, 6071m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:09.19--
Ariocha, the Dreadlord tells you that the extremities - head, feet, and hands - are what you most need to focus on, as this is where most heat is lost from. If you can keep your fingers warm, Ariocha, the Dreadlord tells you, you will have made a good start.
5846h, 6071m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:13.18--
Ariocha, the Dreadlord warns that even this may not be enough. She instructs you to be constantly aware of the temperature of each part of your body. If any part of you begins to feel numb instead of cold, she warns, you need to immediately seek heat.
5846h, 6081m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:17.19--
The most deadly thing of all, Ariocha, the Dreadlord tells you, is when you begin to feel more warm than cold. Feeling cold is natural, she explains, and should not be fought - only the damage from it. A deep inner warmth can be a symptom of approaching death, she tells you, looking serious.
5846h, 6071m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:21.21--
To finish the lesson, Ariocha, the Dreadlord explains a variety of more mundane ways of maintaining warmth - eating full meals, dressing comfortably, and staying in motion. She tells you that maintaining these practices can keep you away from an emergency situation.
5846h, 6061m, 24320e, 22940w  exckdb-2025-s08:02:25.20--

A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. There are 2 monolith sigils in 2 groups here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A crystalline golem stands here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey.  Mathonwy I'llur, Vindicator of Faith is riding on a black Dardanic stallion. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right. You see a sign indicating there are WARES for sale here.

Lichlord Mercantile (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. There are 2 monolith sigils in 2 groups here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A crystalline golem stands here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey.  Mathonwy I'llur, Vindicator of Faith is riding on a black Dardanic stallion. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right. You see a sign indicating there are WARES for sale here.
You see exits leading west (open door) and down (closed door).

An obsidian eye sigil is here. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A crystalline golem stands here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey.  Mathonwy I'llur, Vindicator of Faith is riding on a black Dardanic stallion. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right. You see a sign indicating there are WARES for sale here.
You see exits leading west (open door) and down (closed door).

Created by Phaestus and given a soul by Proteus in return for Phaestus's eternal loyalty, dwarves are doughty and loyal humanoids. Grouped in clans from the central Siroccian Mountains to Inbhir Ness in the far north and the Vasnari Mountains of Meropis, they prefer the relative solitude of the highlands to the hustle and bustle of cities. Nevertheless, they are often found in leadership positions as everyone has heard the maxim: dependable as a dwarf.

Dwarves are unmistakably stocky, with muscular builds that retain their strength even into extreme old age. Skinny or slender dwarves are very rare. Most stand around four feet short, though there are rare cases of giant dwarves who grow to reach human height. Their skin tone is naturally pale or ruddy, but those with tanned and dark skin are not unheard of, and their facial features are rounded, often with button or bulbous noses. Beards are prevalent among male dwarves, and most consider a long, thick beard to be a mark of pride. Many of the females can grow beards as well, though they have a tendency to remove their facial hair. Red or dark hair is very common, though blond is not particularly unusual, and it is generally thick and/or curly in texture. The eyes, too, are typically dark (brown or black) but many have blue, green, or grey eyes as well.

Created by Phaestus and given a soul by Proteus in return for Phaestus's eternal loyalty, dwarves are doughty and loyal humanoids. Grouped in clans from the central Siroccian Mountains to Inbhir Ness in the far north and the Vasnari Mountains of Meropis, they prefer the relative solitude of the highlands to the hustle and bustle of cities. Nevertheless, they are often found in leadership positions as everyone has heard the maxim: dependable as a dwarf.

Dwarves are unmistakably stocky, with muscular builds that retain their strength even into extreme old age. Skinny or slender dwarves are very rare. Most stand around four feet short, though there are rare cases of giant dwarves who grow to reach human height. Their skin tone is naturally pale or ruddy, but those with tanned and dark skin are not unheard of, and their facial features are rounded, often with button or bulbous noses. Beards are prevalent among male dwarves, and most consider a long, thick beard to be a mark of pride. Many of the females can grow beards as well, though they have a tendency to remove their facial hair. Red or dark hair is very common, though blond is not particularly unusual, and it is generally thick and/or curly in texture. The eyes, too, are typically dark (brown or black) but many have blue, green, or grey eyes as well.

Lichlord Mercantile (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. There are 2 monolith sigils in 2 groups here. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A crystalline golem stands here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. Gracefully preening her white feathers, a giant white swan rests here. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey.  Mathonwy I'llur, Vindicator of Faith is riding on a black Dardanic stallion. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right. You see a sign indicating there are WARES for sale here.

Subject: Mul.. Weather!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce a massive update to our weather system! As you've probably heard us joke many times over the past, the weather system was one of those sections of code that was held together with some unholy blood pact - true dark magic!

* This new system should simulate real weather a lot more closely, and will eliminate many of the old oddities with the system, such as blizzards when the sun is shining and the like!

* There will be new room and ambience messages based on the current weather, but if you don't want to see them, feel free to CONFIG SEEWEATHER OFF to disable all but the most important ones.

* We've also reintroduced small-scale effects of clothing warmth back in, so you'll get some flavour effects if you're wearing only your boxers in a snowstorm or you're wearing 50 layers in the desert! Those under level 30 will be immune to these effects, by the grace of the Gods.

* Biting cold can now be staved off with a campfire or a heat vibration in the room too! We'll be adding and tweaking more of these RP effects as the system evolves.

* This new system also supports escalation of the weather conditions into more severe phenomena (lightning/thunderstorms, tornados, etc.), which we'll enable at a later date!

* The old, generalised weather conditions have been imported into the new system, so you shouldn't notice any major changes in the climate, but we'll undoubtedly be making adjustments to everything to really breathe more life into them. In the event that you find something that is -way- off, please file a BUG with as much information as possible.

Bloodworms (Apostasy)                         Known: Yes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Syntax:            SUMMON BLOODWORMS
Works on/against:  Room
Cooldown:          4.00 seconds of equilibrium
Resource:          500 mana
Details:
When the Malevolent One was sealed beneath hundreds of tons of rock, His
strength to break free was stretched to its limit on multiple levels.
Maggots and worms feed on what remained of the shell of a body He had
initially constructed for Himself. Upon returning to His glory, He found
these worms, bloated with the plunder of His flesh -- and with His
power. When you summon the bloodworms, they will, after a moment, burst
forth, spreading out into the surrounding rooms and attacking all with
their poisoned psychic screams. All those who are not deaf will firstly
suffer from masochism, then dizziness. If both afflictions are present,
they will suffer in both mind and body.

* Room credits are now a prize possibility! There's never been a better time to start or expand your manor!

* Two different types of potted plants. These are fun little items that provide entertainment to their owner and guests! You may get a potted lycopod sapling, which is every bit as prickly as their larger siblings, or a potted corpse flower plant, whose blooms have a very distinctive scent. These items come in horticulturist's crate, allowing  them to be traded between players, and binding to them once removed. When dropped in the owner's house or ship cabin, they'll reset there until picked up (in which case, they'll reset to the owner's inventory).

Additionally, we've randomised the talisman pieces contained within the globes, adding in some pieces from prior events and promotions! Try your luck and you might find pieces from talismans in the Azatlan, Historical, and Marks sets.

We hope you enjoy these fun new items! Head over to http://www.achaea.com/credits to pick up your Globes today!

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 4 monolith sigils in 4 groups here. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Observing from high above the ground is a reticulated giraffe. A small pinch of realgar crystals rests upon the ground. There are 4 pinches of ground cinnabar in a group here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness.  The Red Dragon Entaro's imposing form looms. Vanquisher Medi Dracrotalus is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 4 monolith sigils in 4 groups here. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Observing from high above the ground is a reticulated giraffe. A small pinch of realgar crystals rests upon the ground. There are 4 pinches of ground cinnabar in a group here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness.  The Red Dragon Entaro's imposing form looms. Vanquisher Medi Dracrotalus is here.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 4 monolith sigils in 4 groups here. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Observing from high above the ground is a reticulated giraffe. A small pinch of realgar crystals rests upon the ground. There are 4 pinches of ground cinnabar in a group here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness.  The Red Dragon Entaro's imposing form looms. Vanquisher Medi Dracrotalus is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading west.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 4 monolith sigils in 4 groups here. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Observing from high above the ground is a reticulated giraffe. A small pinch of realgar crystals rests upon the ground. There are 4 pinches of ground cinnabar in a group here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness.  The Red Dragon Entaro's imposing form looms. Vanquisher Medi Dracrotalus is here, sleeping soundly. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 4 monolith sigils in 4 groups here. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. Observing from high above the ground is a reticulated giraffe. A small pinch of realgar crystals rests upon the ground. There are 4 pinches of ground cinnabar in a group here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. The shadows bend and contort to the form of this nightmare, red eyes glaring from out of the darkness.  The Red Dragon Entaro's imposing form looms. Vanquisher Medi Dracrotalus is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his right hand.
You see a single exit leading west.

A small pinch of realgar crystals rests upon the ground. There are 4 pinches of ground cinnabar in a group here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings.

Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance.
