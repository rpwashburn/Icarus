From   : Reznik

Subject: Historical Musings and Future Plans
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Orklanishkal,

You know, I finally put my finger on why I was so livid when you failed to back me up against Babel.

I was reading though my notes and I remembered why I was called back from my infiltration of the Priests and Shallam.  I mean, aside from the fact that a former Demiurge was rebelling against you, and that you were being openly mocked by probates.

Let us compare my excommunication and outguilding to your removal from Ashtan.

Both times, an external organization, one ostensibly friendly with the Occultists, put undue pressure on the House to act against its own interests.

When you were driven out for outguilding Xadzia, I came back from my infiltration of the Priests full of righteous fury and threw myself into improving the House and I stood up to Ashtan.  It made our lives difficult.  Erhon worked against the House for decades, and it was a pain in the ass for you and everyone else - but we stood by you.  It was the right thing to do.

Were you removed from the House for being kicked out of Ashtan?  No.  Were you grilled and blamed by your own House for something that was not your fault?  No.

Babel did to me what Erhon did to you, and what did you do?

You stayed silent.

You were Amunet's conscience, and you stayed silent.

You were the man who best understood the position I was placed in and you said nothing in my defense.

You are weak.  You are spineless.  You became a thrall to a God that wishes to destroy Sapience, one that represents only the destructive aspect of Chaos, and you let yourself be cowed by a drunk and a lunatic when you had a chance to stand up and make a difference.  To repay me for centuries of unwaveringly loyal service.

The stubbornness and determination I showed against those that persecuted you was wholly absent when I was persecuted by Babel.  You let them hang me with the same stubbornness I used to defend you, and you had the gall to act like I'd brought it on myself.

It is people like you that have allowed the Occultists to languish in stasis.  People with your lack of drive and vision.  People with your lack of backbone.  Mindless bureaucrats paying lip service to madmen and swilling drinks while the rest of Sapience sailed on past.

You were a horrible Demiurge.  You let the House walk all over you, and you let Ashtan walk all over you.  I came back to save you and House both.  You returned the favor by letting Babel walk all over you, and me, and centuries of tradition.

I did what needed to be done, and then I got out of the way to let others lead.

I look forward to the destruction of the Occultist House.  I loved it dearly as a Guild and House, but it is now an empty shell, just a building where great works were once done and great schemes hatched.  A relic that has failed to evolve, adapt or change as Sapience has changed time and time again around it.

From   : Reznik
To     : Sensei Eliana Sehr'asa
Subject: An Apology
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Greetings, Sapience.

I have an apology to issue today.  To the Ashura, and in particular, to former Archdragon Eliana.

In the latter years of my employment by the Occultists and the Nihilists I found myself restless.  Bored.  I'd been an Occultist most of my years, and I wanted something different.  A new class.

So I asked Babel and Amunet, then the Demiurge of the Occultists if there were any organizations that they wished for me to spy on or worm my way in to.  At the time, the Ashura were led by Eliana, who was skeptical of the value to Ashtan of a God that wished to destroy Ashtan, along with the rest of the world.  Babel, and as a result, Amunet, wanted her monitored, and if need be - silenced.

Simply slaying someone does not achieve this result.  Often, it has the opposite effect, as Babel has found to his disdain.  But I was regarded, correctly, as a man with a delicate touch and a silver tongue, one who could perhaps do what a knife in the back could not.

I changed class and joined the Ashura.  I quietly informed the Nihilists and Amunet of their activities - generally of no harm - but Eliana remained quite inquisitive about Babel, and was beginning to organize those that disagreed with His tenets and philosophy.

I can no longer recall the catalyst, but Eliana finally tipped her hand about her doubts in Babel and plans to organize against Him and His in the city.  I analyzed the situation, discerned the best path, consulted with Amunet and Babel, and then I acted.  I pretended to be scandalized, and I wrote a post about how I could no longer stay in a House that harbored such treasonous intentions and quit the House.

My actions were more effective than I thought they would be.  Eliana stepped down as Archdragon and went inactive.  I returned to the Occultists and Babel's influence in Ashtan grew unchecked.

I regret this for three reasons.

First, because of what I did to Eliana.  Eliana had been a friend of mine.  She had been loyal to me, and she did not deserve what I did to her.

Eliana, if you ever read this, I am truly sorry.

Second, for thinking that Nihilism and Babel were causes worth championing.  Truly, I paid lip service to Babel's goals, simply happy that the Occultists and Chaos had a Patron again at long last.  Babel was not the God of Chaos I had hoped he would be, but I _had_ hoped he would be a worthy and loyal patron for the Occultists, and at the time it seemed he was.  I regret paving the way for Babel's domination of the city.

Thirdly, for spying on the Ashura.  The Ashura have typically been the least dramatic or machiavellian of the Ashtani Guilds or Houses and tirelessly loyal to the city.  They did not deserve to be spied on or manipulated.

I am truly sorry for what I did in the name of what I thought to be a worthy cause.

Please forgive me.

Subject: A Wolf in Goat's Clothing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The merry bleating of Actar's horned inhabitants quickly died out as a mysterious creature abducted Bodo's furry companions. Although no one had seen the creature, the bloody remains of creamy goats and wargoats suggested that it was large, and hungry!

A hunting party was formed, led by the the halfling Orbus and Oceana Dawyn, whose nose proved more valuable than that of the keenest hound. Tracing bones, horns and tufts of fur, Sarathai El'Rihwin and the Druidess picked up Elstan Vorondil and followed the trail of gore to the foot of the Southern Vashnars. After the idea of "borrowing" goats from other areas in Sapience had fallen on deaf ears, Shirszae Nynniaw said her goodbyes to Biba and joined the adventurous group on their quest.

When no other could, Orbus' trained ears heard a rumble underfoot where the bloody trail ended. Not long after, Sarathai and Shirszae heard the sounds as well and Sarathai discovered a hidden cave, its sole inhabitant the cause of Actar's gruesome slaughter.

Her hiding place uncovered, Zasag was clearly not amused. A difficult discussion ensued to convince the Cyclops to stop stealing and eating Actar's goats. Alternatives were hunted and offered to the hungry woman, Elstan being the first to deliver a wolf. Without hesitation, Zasag devoured the wolf unblinkingly, leaving a bloody mess in her cavern.

Other animals were offered, but the eternally hungry cyclops would only touch the presumably delicious wolves. Filled to the brim and finally satisfied for as long as it lasted, Zasag accepted Sarathai's proposal and vowed to never steal goats again, so long as she is provided with her favourite meat. Rumour has it that those brave enough to serve her will be rewarded handsomely.

A slimy handshake, dripping with spit, later and the deal was sealed.

               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Summary: Orbus and Bodo received help from a dedicated group of adventurers as they hunted down the thief and killer of Actar's goats. Zasag, the Swift was found hiding in a hidden cave at the foot of the Southern Vashnars and convinced to eat wolves instead. The cyclops offers a reward to those who bring her favourite meat.

Subject: A Rat in the Hand
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 In the land of Minia, the ground began to rumble with ominous portent. The bickering blaming of the Imp Lord and Pixie Queen were cut off by the shouted threats of one Pieranotzu, the Ravenous who carried tidings of domination and destruction!

A high-pitched scream interrupted them all as a pit opened in the Pixie schoolyard, swallowing up a young pixie girl and causing a congregation at the pit. Rhilas, a hunter, arrived on the scene with information on this Pieranotzu, a rat of unusual size he had been tracking for some time. He quickly instructed the gathered adventurers how to collapse the pits with a contraption of his own design but before they could test it, rats began pouring out!

Throughout Minia the brave adventures battled the seemingly endless hordes of rats. Felling dozens and closing pit after pit with stalwart determination. Finally, seeing his enemies gathered at the portals, Pieranotzu gathered his rats for a final strike!  As the adventurers gathered to face him, Rhilas struck first blood, plunging a dagger into his exposed back.

The cowardly rat fled the portals, leaving a blood trail that the adventurers were easily able to follow. It lead them to an entrance to a warren in Minia. At Rhilas' urging, they plunged inside, eager to save the young pixie who had fallen in and destroy Pieranotzu once and for all!

The final battle saw Silvay, Ashcraft, Laetetia, Tyreon, Ziani, and Zelas arrayed against the great rat who did not stand a chance against their combined might. He quickly fell and the brave adventurers found the young pixie soon after, excited to see them and unharmed.

Though the day was saved, Rhilas warned this was unlikely the last we would hear of Pieranotzu and his black warren! Young adventurers be alert!

               ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Summary: A dangerous rat lord threatened to overrun Minia and he and his army were driven off by a merry bunch of young adventurers, revealing a dangerous black warren and future adventures to be had in the process!
