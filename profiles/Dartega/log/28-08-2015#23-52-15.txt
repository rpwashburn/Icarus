ANNOUNCE NEWS #4415                                     (08/28/2015 at 16:11)

Subject: Mul.. Weather!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce a massive update to our weather system! As you've probably heard us joke many times over the past, the weather system was one of those sections of code that was held together with some unholy blood pact - true dark magic!

* This new system should simulate real weather a lot more closely, and will eliminate many of the old oddities with the system, such as blizzards when the sun is shining and the like!

* There will be new room and ambience messages based on the current weather, but if you don't want to see them, feel free to CONFIG SEEWEATHER OFF to disable all but the most important ones.

* We've also reintroduced small-scale effects of clothing warmth back in, so you'll get some flavour effects if you're wearing only your boxers in a snowstorm or you're wearing 50 layers in the desert! Those under level 30 will be immune to these effects, by the grace of the Gods.

* Biting cold can now be staved off with a campfire or a heat vibration in the room too! We'll be adding and tweaking more of these RP effects as the system evolves.

* This new system also supports escalation of the weather conditions into more severe phenomena (lightning/thunderstorms, tornados, etc.), which we'll enable at a later date!

* The old, generalised weather conditions have been imported into the new system, so you shouldn't notice any major changes in the climate, but we'll undoubtedly be making adjustments to everything to really breathe more life into them. In the event that you find something that is -way- off, please file a BUG with as much information as possible.

With the head and upper body of an enormous snow-white tiger and the lower body of a massive feathered white serpent, Chenubis, the Cloud Serpent is a striking sight to behold. Adding to his bizarre yet beautiful appearance are a pair of gigantic muscular white wings sprouting from his shoulders. Two smaller pairs of white wings can be seen set along the serpent portion of his body. He regards his surroundings through eyes the brilliant blue of a cloudless sky, deep with an ancient wisdom. Wisps of white smoke curl out around his nostrils, and from deep in his throat, he emits a low growling purr. Although his expression is benign, he reflexively sheathes and unsheathes his long, curved white claws, on constant watch for danger as the anointed guardian of Arcadia. His lower serpent body ceaselessly shifts and undulates in slow, hypnotizing motions, its full length more than two dozen feet long.
Chenubis, the Cloud Serpent does not even register your presence as a threat.
He has 100% health remaining.
He weighs about 1000 pounds.

13.7 HEALING AND CURING

            |                           Curatives and What They |
       13.6 < SAFE ROOMS                         Cure or Cause. > 13.7.1

(For the Priestly skill: HELP HEALING)
(For Achaea's in-built healing system: HELP CURINGSYSTEM)

Healing in Achaea may be accomplished in a number of ways, dependent upon your
resources and what it is you wish to heal or cure.


Sleeping and Meditating
-----------------------
Healing of health and endurance may be accomplished by sleeping, while mana and
willpower may be healed via meditation. SLEEP will put you to sleep, WAKE will
wake you up, MEDITATE will cause you to meditate and any command will cause you
to cease meditating. These are the most basic methods of healing, but they are
not really sufficient for an experienced adventurer, as they are slow and
require that you do not do anything else while performing them.

The other ways of healing are legion. They include abilities in various skills,
salves, elixirs, plants, and smoking. Nothing need be said here about the
abilities, as suitable help may be found on those within the skills. However,
the other methods need some explanation.


Elixirs and Tonics
------------------
Elixirs and tonics are fluids that may restore health and mana, cure
afflictions, or set up various defences. They come in the various types of
vials found throughout the land, and when full, can be used many times before
running out.

You may refer to elixirs and tonics by the vial they are in. For example, if
you were holding mahogany vial111, you would DRINK 111. Or, as is generally
more convenient, you may DRINK <fluid name> to drink from the first vial
in your inventory containing that type of fluid. For example: DRINK HEALTH.

You may purchase elixirs and tonics from marketplaces around Achaea. Elixirs

13.7.8 Achaea's server-side curing

            |                            Adventurer vs. Denizen |
     13.7.7 < Entanglement                               Combat > 13.8

Achaea's combat system offers an unprecedented level of depth, providing
multiple layers of afflictions and ailments. While this makes it enjoyable, it
can also make it difficult to get started in.

To aide in this endeavour, we provide a server-side system to aide in the
curing of these ailments. This should allow all adventurers to partake in
player-vs-player combat at all levels.

The following commands are available with the system:

CURING                               - Brings up a list of commands available
                                       in the system.
CURING STATUS                        - Shows the status of your curing.

CURING ON|OFF                        - Enables and disables the core of the
                                       system.
CURING AFFLICTIONS ON|OFF            - Enables and disables affliction curing.
CURING DEFENCES ON|OFF               - Enables or disables defence upkeep.
CURING SIPPING ON|OFF                - Enables or disables health/mana sipping.
CURING TRANSMUTATION ON|OFF          - Enables or disables the use of
                                       Transmutation cures.

CURING SIPHEALTH|SIPMANA <percent>   - What percentage of maximum health/mana
                                       to sip health/mana at.
CURING MOSSHEALTH|MOSSMANA <percent> - What percentage of maximum health/mana
                                       to eat moss/potash at.
CURING PRIORITY HEALTH|MANA          - Prioritise health or mana regeneration.
CURING FOCUS ON|OFF                  - Toggle the use of the FOCUS ability in
                                       survival.
CURING FOCUS FIRST|SECOND            - Toggle whether to use the focus ability
                                       before herb cures or after.
CURING TREE ON|OFF                   - Toggle the use of the TREE tattoo to
                                       cure afflictions.
CURING CLOTAT <amount>               - Configure how much bleeding is needed
                                       before the system will CLOT.

Advanced options
----------------
While the default curing priority should be suitable in most cases, we've
provided a way to adjust the order in which you cure afflictions and keep
defences active.

CURING PRIORITY LIST                  - List the affliction cure priority.
CURING PRIORITY <name> <1-25>         - Move an affliction's cure priority.
CURING PRIORITY RESET                 - Reset the cure priority to the default.

For more information on the various afflictions, please be sure to look at
AFFLICTION LIST.

CURING PRIORITY DEFENCE LIST          - List the defence upkeep priority.
CURING PRIORITY DEFENCE <name> <1-25> - Move an defence's upkeep priority.
CURING PRIORITY DEFENCE RESET         - Reset the defence upkeep priority.

No default priority for defence upkeep is provided. For more information on the
various defences, please be sure to look at DEFENCE LIST.

CURINGSETs allow multiple pre-configured curing and defence priority lists.
These can be changed between quickly and easily without having to manually
reconfigure the priorities.

CURINGSET NEW <name>                  - Create a new curingset.
CURINGSET LIST                        - List curingsets.
CURINGSET SWITCH <name>               - Switch to a curingset.
CURINGSET DELETE <name>               - Delete a curingset.
CURINGSET RENAME <oldname> <newname>  - Rename a curingset.
CURINGSET EXPAND                      - Purchase an additional curing set.
                                        Costs 100 credits and is
                                        non-refundable.

Manual manipulation
-------------------
Situations can change in the blink of an eye, and there may be times when you
wish to force a command to take precedence over any other curing priority. To
do this, simply add it to the queue, and it will be done before any other
scheduled commands.

About the system and latency
----------------------------
The system is designed to cure your afflictions at a rate that simulates
average latency, so the time it would have normally taken for Achaea to send
the message to your computer and back to the game. This means:
- Most people will see no noticeable difference in curing efficiency using
  server-side or client-side... it's a matter of preference, much like which
  internet browser to use.
- For people with very high latency (if you are on dial-up internet, for
  instance), using Achaea's server-side curing may be much faster than using
  a third-party client.
- For someone with extremely low latency (if you are located in Chicago near
  the IRE servers with fiber-optic service) you might be able to cure yourself
  a fraction of a second faster with a local system.

19.10.2 Offensive Artefacts

    19.10.1 < Artefacts Overview            Defensive Artefacts > 19.10.3

(see also HELP ARTEFACTS, HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS, HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for the
owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone else's
inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.


-------------------
OFFENSIVE ARTEFACTS
-------------------
Within the Offensive artefact category, we have two sub-categories:

Enhanced weapons
   - These are weapons with stats that are superior to the
     statistically average weapon of that type.

Special weapons
   - These are offensive artefacts whose advantage is not based in the
     three weapon statistics (damage, to-hit, and speed).

   - With your blade in your hand, "ATTACH BAND TO SWORD" to convert it
     into an artefact weapon, adding an additional 5%/10%/15% speed and
     damage. This also makes the weapon reset to its owner.
   - These may be DETACHed as well.
   - Blademaster swords are not able to take on the Asp add-on.

Bows:  These shoot more quickly, do more damage, and hit more easily than a
       darkbow. The damage and to-hit percentages aren't possible to give
       because they are only one of many factors - suffice it to say that
       the more expensive bows are more accurate and do more damage.

  Note: The base price of bows is based on having the DARKBOWS ability.
        Should you not have this class ability, you can purchase the
        "shooting" option via the ARTEFACT command, which grants the
        owner the ability to use the SHOOT command:
           SHOOT <adventurer> <direction> -or-
           SHOOT <adventurer> WITH METEOR.

Asp
---
For 750 credits, you may add the Asp ability to almost any artefact edged
weapon. This is achieved via ARTEFACT <item> ADD ASP.

The Asp ability causes the weapon to hit with a random venom each time, and 1/3
of the time no specific venom message is given. If there are venoms on the
weapon, the venoms will be delivered and the asp will not take effect. If there
are no venoms, asp will take effect.

For the purposes of adding Asp ability, knuckles do not count as edged weapons.

The asp ability may be traded in. It is valued at two-thirds (500 credits).

Special Weapons
---------------
Armbands of the Fist
   - These armbands allow Tekura users to hit more often with their punches
     and kicks. The precise effect is difficult to express, but is similar
     to raising the to-hit of a weapon by 10%, 15% or 20%. This effect is
     not limited by the type of target in any way, denizen or adventurer.

   Bronze Armband of the Fist   Raises to-hit by 10%   200 credits
   Copper Armband of the Fist   Raises to-hit by 15%   500 credits
   Steel Armband of the Fist    Raises to-hit by 20%  1000 credits

Boomerangs: 450 credits
   - Throw these at someone in your line of sight (up to 10 rooms away) and
     the boomerang will try to bring your target to you. The syntax is:
     THROW BOOMERANG AT <target> <direction>
   * one-way exits will defeat boomerangs.
   * the same things that prevent a yank will prevent a boomerang from
     succeeding (impaled, massed, stand firm, rooted, clinging) plus
     grounding vibes, being at a dock, restrained by tentacles or grave
     hands, or a rite of piety.

Bracers of Flame: 400 credits
   - Grants the wielder the ability to FIRELASH and cast FIREWALLS.

Bracers of Frost: 1000 credits

Critical Hit Pendants
   - These pendants allow you to get extra critical hits when hunting.
     Everybody, at every level, has a chance of getting a critical hit.
     The higher the level, the higher the chance of getting a critical
     hit _and_ the higher the chance of getting harder hits. These
     pendants increase both the chance of getting a critical hit and
     the chance of getting harder hits. To give a couple of examples
     of critical hit chances: level 50 = 1.6% chance of getting a
     critical hit; level 65 = 6.4%; level 80 = 16.6%.

   Fire pendant              2% increased chance       200 credits
   Blood pendant             4% increased chance       600 credits

And soon your nose bears that soft scratch, his cockhead welcomed so deeply in your swallowing, bucking recess. With both hands steadying your face, an loving warmth touches his as he begins to pound, taking his pleasure from your wanton smile, stroking himself against your silver tongue and tipping his head back on a riotous boast."
