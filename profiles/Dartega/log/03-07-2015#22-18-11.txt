To     : Everyone
Subject: Library Project Completed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hail Mhaldor,

I am proud to announce the completion of a major Library Project some of you were working on with me throughout the year! We now have five new volumes on Mhaldorian Sermons and Rituals!

This project was to grow the resources for those studying rituals and sermons to have at their fingertips. Prior to this project the most recent book on Mhaldorian sermons and rituals in our Scriptorium were all from before the year 383AF.

Below are the new additons that were put into circulation:

J113628  Mhaldorian Sermons and Rituals Vol. 1 (383AF - 450AF)
J39282   Mhaldorian Sermons and Rituals Vol. 2 (451AF - 550AF)
J157194  Mhaldorian Sermons and Rituals Vol. 3 (551AF - 600AF)
J41090   Mhaldorian Sermons and Rituals Vol. 4 (601AF - 650AF)
J396230  Mhaldorian Sermons and Rituals Vol. 5 (651AF - 686AF)


I want to personally thank Argathian, Duelist of the Seven; Herenicus Coldraven; Nercyllis, Crusher of Wills; and Ysela, Herald of Iniquity for their amazing research throughout the year.

I also want to thank Minister Taraus for allowing this project to commence and the support you've given me for these projects, it is very much appreciated. Lastly, thank you Dreadlord Xer for your personal contribution for this project.

I am very pleased with the outcome of this project and the thoroughness everyone put in. Well done!


In His Service,

Kitiara Lichlord
Librarian of Mhaldor

Penned by my hand on the 4th of Glacian, in the year 687 AF.

The Champions' Bridge.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "What will you do for Creation today?" An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

The Champions' Bridge.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "What will you do for Creation today?" An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently. A fiery efreeti spins madly here.  A large barracks is here providing the city's forces with rest and refuge.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.

6100h, 5890m, 25425e, 22682w  exckdb---s03:41:23.27--
Taraus ceases to wield a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in her left hand.
Taraus ceases to wield a flashy, razor-sharp dirk in her right hand.
Taraus starts to wield a motley guttersnipe's bow in her hands.
6100h, 5890m, 25425e, 22682w  exckdb---s03:41:23.55--
Hasar vigorously spins a crystal egg, and it begins to hover in the air.

Hasar's aura of weapons rebounding disappears.
Hasar makes a forceful gesture and some crystals embed themselves into the ground.

Approaching the Champions' Bridge (road).
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An heraldic pennon flies here, bearing the city arms of Targossas. Resting on the ground is a cube-shaped silver sigil. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Twitching its wings, a charcoal black hippogriff majestically stands here. A white pearl butterfly beats its delicate wings nearby. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A miniature snowy owl perches here, watching her surroundings with great interest. Scampering in circles, a squirrel monkey is here.  Tyrannus Xinna, Dread Legate is riding on a stone gargoyle. Her features are obscured by a mask. She wields an elegant Mhaldorian rapier in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right. Lord Watchman Dracrotalus is riding on a blood steed. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a vorpal sword in his right. The soul of Daitya roams the land, bodiless. His gaze sweeping the area, Dreadlord Xer Savril stands here, a wary expression on his face. His features are obscured by a mask. Lord Marshal Hasar Lichlord is riding on a stubborn mule. He wields a deep red boomerang in his left hand and a scimitar in his right.

Narrowing your eyes, you squint off toward the north.
The Champions' Bridge.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "What will you do for Creation today?" An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. There are 2 Shornwall defenders here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Hung from the western column of the arch that forms the city gates, a gilt-edged indigo scroll proudly displays the Bloodsworn decree on innocence. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
Gateway to Targossas.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A dense mist of silver ripples in the air around the immense form of Ilona'neron, the Colossus. Lambent energy pulses around the skeletal frame of a Naxian mistweaver. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Poised for action, a Blackstone swordsman observes the surrounds. Gripping a broadsword, a Shornwall defender crouches slightly in anticipation. An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. An obsidian eye sigil is here. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance.

An attentive Duskmere brawler stands ready with his halberd, his keen eyes missing nothing. Eyes keenly raised to the skies, a cowled bow-maiden plucks idly at her bowstring.

Amid the thriving indigo.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. Resting on the ground is a cube-shaped silver sigil. An indigo nightfire butterfly flutters here peacefully. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A razor-beaked falcon looms overhead, seeking prey.  Lord Watchman Dracrotalus is here. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a vorpal sword in his right.

You slip away to the east and successfully evade your pursuers.
Within the indigo fields.
The bright sun shines down, blanketing you with its life-giving warmth. Pale violet flowers bloom upon a bushy indigo plant. Scouring the ground for food, a small armadillo noses around. Wings wrapped about herself, a ghost bat hangs from a nearby perch. A miniature snowy owl perches here, watching her surroundings with great interest. A yellow-bellied marmot whistles to himself as he scurries rapidly about. A pygmy jarbo hops around with endless energy. A frisky goat kid bounds about. Here stands a restless mountain eagle, arrogantly surveying his surroundings. There are 6 aurum flakes in 4 groups here. There are 6 goldenseal roots in 2 groups here. There are 6 ferrum flakes in 2 groups here. There are 2 potash crystals in 2 groups here.
