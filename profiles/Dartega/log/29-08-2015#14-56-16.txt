Subject: Mul.. Weather!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're pleased to announce a massive update to our weather system! As you've probably heard us joke many times over the past, the weather system was one of those sections of code that was held together with some unholy blood pact - true dark magic!

* This new system should simulate real weather a lot more closely, and will eliminate many of the old oddities with the system, such as blizzards when the sun is shining and the like!

* There will be new room and ambience messages based on the current weather, but if you don't want to see them, feel free to CONFIG SEEWEATHER OFF to disable all but the most important ones.

* We've also reintroduced small-scale effects of clothing warmth back in, so you'll get some flavour effects if you're wearing only your boxers in a snowstorm or you're wearing 50 layers in the desert! Those under level 30 will be immune to these effects, by the grace of the Gods.

* Biting cold can now be staved off with a campfire or a heat vibration in the room too! We'll be adding and tweaking more of these RP effects as the system evolves.

* This new system also supports escalation of the weather conditions into more severe phenomena (lightning/thunderstorms, tornados, etc.), which we'll enable at a later date!

* The old, generalised weather conditions have been imported into the new system, so you shouldn't notice any major changes in the climate, but we'll undoubtedly be making adjustments to everything to really breathe more life into them. In the event that you find something that is -way- off, please file a BUG with as much information as possible.
