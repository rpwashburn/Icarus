Subject: A new year, a new day for Achaea
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The day is here! The much anticipated tradeskill split is upon us! This is the largest single code update we've ever done; introducing several new class skills, a slew of new trade skills, updates to weapons and armour, and much more.

Here's the list of major changes:

- Class-based tradeskills are now available for all players! This adds another massive area of character customisation, allowing you to be an Apostate who concocts venomous toxins, or a Bard who harvests primes and minerals. See HELP TRADESKILLS for more information

- Knight classes have had their forging skill replaced with a new skill, Weaponmastery! This is a new specialisation based skill that allows four unique fighting styles! Check out HELP WEAPONMASTERY for all of the details. Your skill level in forging has been directly transferred to the new skill. If you were a journeyman, your chivalry skill level has been translated across to Weaponmastery.

- We've opened up free Weaponmastery respecialisation for two weeks, and during this time, there is no need for weapon proficiencies.

- Alchemists have had the Transmutation skill replaced with Formulation! This skill provides Alchemists the ability to formulate new gasses and liquids (usable only by the creator) that can turn the tide of any battle. See HELP FORMULATION for further information.

- Magi have had their enchanting skill replaced with Artificing, a new skill in which they create and control a large crystalline golem! HELP ARTIFICING!

- All lessons invested in previous tradeskills (Cooking, Gathering, Inkmilling, Jewellery,  Tailoring) have been refunded. Any previous permits have been converted back into "a bronze trade seal", this item can be used in place of the 200cr fee for re-obtaining any tradeskill permit (Cooking, Jewellery, Tailoring). These seals can be traded in for 200cr, should their owner no longer want them.

- Crafters who previously had Cooking, Jewellery, and Tailoring have been gifted with a special item that will allow them to continue to cook/sew/craft all of their previous designs without learning the skill again. Naturally, they're free to re-learn the tradeskill to continue designing new items.

- The rapier weapon proficiency has been removed, all adventurers with this proficiency have been gifted "a worn whetstone", which can be used to learn a new weapon proficiency at no cost.

- Forging has been overhauled! The random element of forging is gone, meaning that if you're after a longsword or a scimitar, you do not need to spend days or weeks at the forge trying to find that perfect weapon or armour. See HELP FORGING for more details. All existing weapons and armour have be normalised to their new stats.

- Artefact weapon statistics have been adjusted; they will always be upgrades compared to the new standardised forged values.

[Type MORE if you wish to continue reading. (50% shown)]

[File continued via MORE]
- All artefact knight weapons have been given a one-off switch to another knight weapon of the same level. This is a ***ONE-TIME ONLY SWITCH***, so be especially sure of your choice, as we will not change it after it is done. To do this, simply EXCHANGE <weapon#> FOR <new weapon type>. e.g. EXCHANGE RAPIER1234 FOR BROADSWORD. If the weapon was customised, you'll receive a figurine to be used for a future customisation. Weapons with the ASP addon will transfer across, assuming the other weapon can support it. In the event you're swapping an ASP'ed sword for a blunt weapon, the ASP fee will be refunded.

- Abilities that are affected by weapon stats have been rebalanced to factor in the new values.

- Class-based armour and shield restrictions still exist, but anyone with the Armoursmithing ability will be able to forge and sell any armour; fullplate is no longer bound to the forger who made it!

- Armoursmiths and weaponsmiths can modify their forged goods with a variety of descriptors (e.g. "elegant" or "serrated" can be specified to make "an elegant rapier" or "a serrated broadsword"). As you forge more items, you will unlock more exclusive descriptors to set your wares apart.

- The way armour and shield resistances are displayed has been modified to be more accurate. Rather than an arbitrary value, it will show a percentage that is more in-line with the reduction for most attacks. A 100/100 fullplate doesn't really block 100% of damage, for example. Nothing else has changed with armour, just the way it's displayed.

- Class-only benefits associated with tradeskills (like Concoctions' sip bonus, Enchanting's necklace of purity, and Transmutations's potash bonus) will not be present in the new tradeskills. They will stay in place for the relevant classes until they receive their overhaul (i.e. sentinels will still receive the sip bonus until their replacement skill is implemented).

- Transmutation tonics and balms, and concoctions elixirs and salves have been combined into a new trade skill: Remedies, and have been standardised to the original concoctions names. We've converted all of the vials and tuns of the transmutation cures over for you, and the server-side curing system has been updated to use these, even with mineral/transmutation cures enabled.

- All adventurers have been given a trait reset, if they did not have one already!

- The Hammer of Forging artefact has been removed from the game, as it offers no benefit to the new way of forging. We've given a full refund to anyone who had a hammer at this time.

- Any tradeskill-related artefact purchased within the past 6 months (since June 31, 2014) is eligible for a 100% trade-in. Please email artefacts@achaea.com to arrange this. Artefacts purchased before this will carry their usual 66% value. All of the artefacts will continue to work with the new tradeskills.

- To go alongside these, we've also implemented some other relevant changes to classes and combat, which will be coming in a follow up post in the next few minutes.

As mentioned in the opening, this is the single largest code change in Achaea's history! With this many changes, there's bound to be some quirks! If you encounter anything that seems off, please file a BUG with as much information as possible!

In a change that will, no doubt, COMPLETELY overshadow Tecton's piddling last announce post with all its tiny details and irrelevancies, when you send a message now (persistent msgs using the msg command), a copy will end up in a new permanent folder called 'sent'.

Enjoy, and make sure to tell Tecton he did great so he doesn't feel bad about his post's lack of impact.

Subject: Tradeskill seals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There seems to be some confusion over how the tradeskill seals work, so this is just a quick post to clarify:

1) The seal will replace the 200cr needed to gain a tradeskill license (for skills with submitted designs), you just go to the crafting office as normal and request it.

2) Once you have the license, head to Amarisse and ASK AMARISSE GAIN <the skill that you got the license for>

3) Learn the tradeskill as normal.

If you don't want to learn the tradeskill again, you can trade the seal in for credits with the ARTEFACT <item#> TRADEIN command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In light of, what's being affectionately referred to as, "The big change", we've made some combat-related changes:

Crystalism:
----------
* Some vibration effects and fire rates have been adjusted to better mesh with the new Artificing skill.
* RETARDATION has been reworked. See its AB file for details.

Chivalry
--------
* BATTLECRY will stun for half as long if the shouter is prone.

Elementalism:
-----------
* BLOODBOIL will now only cure one affliction per use.
* BLOODBOIL has had its cooldown halved.
* BLOODBOIL can now be performed while paralysed and prone or with only one arm broken; it is blocked by the haemophilia affliction.
* New ability: QUAKE.
* HAILSTORM has had its equilibrium reduced, but is now a one time affect rather than damage over time. This extends to both Magi
and Sylvan versions, but not to Runelore HUGALAZ.

Harmonics
---------
* HALLELUJAH has had its chance to fail to fire reduced somewhat to bring it more in line with similar abilities.

Necromancy
----------
* LEPROSY has had its equilibrium cost adjusted in the light the knight rework.

Physiology
----------
* TRUEWRACK very slightly slowed down.
* PARALYSIS is no longer TRUEWRACKable; it remains WRACKable.
* TEMPERing is now stopped by shield and prismatic barriers.

Runelore
--------
* The PITHAKHAN runeblade effect will now fire more frequently.
* The LAGUL rune when sketched upon a runeblade will now cause the weapon to inflict increased bleeding on a successful attack.
* The LAGUA rune when sketched upon a runeblade will cause a DISEMBOWEL on a target (utilising the weapon) to cause increased damage if the person suffers from internal trauma.
* The LAGUZ rune when sketched upon a runeblade will cause the weapon to deal increased limb damage.

Voicecraft
----------
* The list of songs that SONGBIRD will sing has been made less redundant; noise and poem have been removed from the available options.

Weaponry
--------
* The NAUSEA affliction will now make you too weak to fully PARRY an attack. Either you will fail to parry the attack entirely, or you will redirect the attack. In the event the attack is redirected, you will still receive damage and afflictions, but the attack will be untargeted and no limb damage will be received.
* SHATTER will now always escalate a limb by exactly one level, regardless of the weapon damage. The health damage dealt is still dependent on the weapon's damage.

Woodlore
--------
* The Woodlore speed bonus has been increased for handaxes as a short-term measure.

Subject: Tradeskills and the restriction on Harvesting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mhaldor,

With the newest changes to our skills, particularly our trade-based ones, you are reminded of the restriction that Mhaldor places upon the tradeskill of harvesting.

With the ability to craft curatives, now termed as 'Remedies' instead of 'Concoctions' or 'Transmutation' from either a plant base or a mineral base, there should be no reason why any Mhaldorian should be caught holding the skillset of harvesting.

It is counter-productive to our cause to return back to a reliance on plants for curatives. If I or my Council find you practising such forest-loving skills or discover you holding such a skill, you will answer to me.

His Eternally,
Tyrannus Ruth I'llur

An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A box lantern of thin red parchment lights the surroundings with cheerful images of Logosmas. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Cracked rock surrounds a sulphurous fissure recently rent in the stony earth.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Lord Marshal Hasar Lichlord is here.
