A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A crystalline golem stands here. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. A nebulous water weird is here. Dripping with blood, an inverted pentagram floats in mid-air. Hovering on two scarlet leathery wings, this daemonite seems to have a vicious glint to its eyes.  Aegoth I'llur, Advocate of Strength is here. He wields a disfigured staff of kindled birch in his left hand and a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his right.
You see a single exit leading west.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. The Blue Dragon Rastriana's imposing form looms.

The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Tessa, Insidium Disciple is here. She wields a glorious, bejeweled longsword in her left hand and a Shield of Absorption in her right. Atalkez al'Dejan, Crusher of Wills is here.

A living vodun doll of Atalkez, its chest heaves a bit and its arms and legs move. Every detail of it is perfectly rendered, though the look in its eyes betrays no intelligence. It is a tool, not a fully living creature.
It has 27 months of usefulness left.
The doll looks to have been fashioned 55 times.
It weighs about 2 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Dartega.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A scorching wall of fire stands here, blocking passage to the up. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Dread Emissary Sefnir, Thrall of Xinna is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. The Golden Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms. The Blue Dragon Rastriana's imposing form looms. Ainly Sar'vet, Apprentice of Manipulation is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand. Dread Legate Krux Lichlord is here, shrouded. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a soulspear in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and up.

Dread Emissary Sefnir, Thrall of Xinna is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. Ainly Sar'vet, Apprentice of Manipulation is here, shrouded.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. This area is unnaturally flooded with water. The waters here have been miraculously parted. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Miniature hands clasped patiently, a diminutive homunculus stands here, its features bearing an uncanny resemblance to Proficy. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. A Baalzadeen demon towers over you, filling you with dread. A crystalline golem stands here. A small grey-brown rattlesnake is coiled here, rattling menacingly.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Dread Emissary Sefnir, Thrall of Xinna is here. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. Aegoth I'llur, Advocate of Strength is here. He wields a disfigured staff of kindled birch in his left hand and a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his right. Dread Legate Krux Lichlord is here, shrouded. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a Dawnrender bastard sword in both hands. The Blue Dragon Rastriana's imposing form looms. Dread Emissary Zuysheam, Thrall of Saibel is here. Ryze, Herald of Iniquity is here, shrouded. Melodie Le'Murzen, Herald of the Insidium is here, shrouded. She wields an oceanic bow of hazelwood in both hands. Dread Legate Proficy, the Merciful is riding on a stone gargoyle. He wields a ranger's bow in both hands.

Narrowing your eyes, you squint off toward the up.
Treacherous mountain path (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. A rune like a lightning bolt has been sketched into the ground here. A rune resembling a volcano has been sketched into the ground here. A rune like a flurry of lightning bolts has been sketched into the ground here. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. Curving her neck coquettishly, a dappled Dardanic filly nibbles at her shoulder. Brimming with energy, a sooty Dardanic colt waits impatiently nearby. A silvery Dardanic mare stands here with a graceful presence. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. A translucent map of Sapience shimmers in the air.
 Quite innocently, a banana peel lies on the ground. An icewall is here, blocking passage to the up. A black mamba slithers here. Spreading its majestic golden wings, a giant eagle searches the ground with piercing eyes. A red-crested falcon focuses its piercing gaze on you as it stands proudly here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  The Golden Dragon Hasar's imposing form looms. Warlord Jhui Ta'sa, Lord of the Crossing is here.

When you regain consciousness, you are confused about where you are and how you got here. Darkness surrounds you, save for a single candle.

A lithe black panther prowls here restlessly, wings carefully folded. Wings wrapped about herself, a ghost bat hangs from a nearby perch. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. An unspecified thing is dead. A dead rattlesnake lies here. A clump of bloodied feathers is all that remains of a miniature snowy owl. A mortal heart, still dripping blood is here. A translucent map of Sapience shimmers in the air.
 A large wall of stone stands here, blocking passage to the down. The tormented form of a hideous abomination writhes here. Inverted wings pointed skyward, Lethe, a great white bat considers her dominion.  The soul of Jhui roams the land, bodiless. Mizik Corten, Herald of Ruin is riding on Lethe, a great white bat. He wields a living puppet of Jinsun in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption in his right.

Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. A Baalzadeen demon towers over you, filling you with dread. Moving to an unheard tune, a dainty ice sprite dances slowly with herself.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. The Blue Dragon Rastriana's imposing form looms. Aegoth I'llur, Advocate of Strength is here. He wields a disfigured staff of kindled birch in his left hand and a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his right. Ryze, Herald of Iniquity is here, shrouded. The Red Dragon Vum's imposing form looms. The Silver Dragon Lideron's imposing form looms. Dread Emissary Zuysheam, Thrall of Saibel is here.

Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. This area is unnaturally flooded with water. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A nimble javelin lies here, abandoned. Miniature hands clasped patiently, a diminutive homunculus stands here, its features bearing an uncanny resemblance to Kaevan. There are 2 throwing axes here. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you. A crystalline golem stands here. A Baalzadeen demon towers over you, filling you with dread. Moving to an unheard tune, a dainty ice sprite dances slowly with herself. A small grey-brown rattlesnake is coiled here, rattling menacingly. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. Inverted wings pointed skyward, Lethe, a great white bat considers her dominion. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side.  Hands of rotting flesh and white bone push up from the ground. Kaevan Lichlord is here. He wields a rustic balanced cavalry shield bearing the city arms of Mhaldor in his left hand. The Blue Dragon Rastriana's imposing form looms. Dread Emissary Zuysheam, Thrall of Saibel is here. Ryze, Herald of Iniquity is here, shrouded. Aspirant Driden, Thrall of Cresil is here. He wields a Lupine bow in both hands. The Red Dragon Vum's imposing form looms. The Silver Dragon Lideron's imposing form looms. Aegoth I'llur, Advocate of Strength is here. He wields a disfigured staff of kindled birch in his left hand and a blackened cavalry shield with ivory accents in his right. Ainly Sar'vet, Apprentice of Manipulation is here, shrouded. He wields a Shield of Absorption in his left hand and a soulspear in his right.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Bloated with blood and flesh, a frenzied bloodworm sets its beady eyes on you.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Dread Legate Kelandra Lichlord is here, her head bowed.
You see exits leading east, south, west, and up.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A crystalline golem stands here. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Curving her neck coquettishly, a dappled Dardanic filly nibbles at her shoulder. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Brimming with energy, a sooty Dardanic colt waits impatiently nearby. A silvery Dardanic mare stands here with a graceful presence. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  Dread Duelist Mathonwy Corso is here. He wields an elemental staff in his left hand. He is surrounded by one reflection of himself.
You see a single exit leading west.
A winged fire serpent tells you, "Dartega has arrived at my location."
