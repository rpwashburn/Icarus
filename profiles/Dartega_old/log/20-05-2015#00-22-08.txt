The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Pale violet flowers bloom upon a bushy indigo plant. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. A dark grey flake of plumbum sparkles upon the floor. An indigo nightfire butterfly flutters here peacefully. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  Commandant Chiam Nithilar is here. The Golden Dragon Aegoth's imposing form looms. Zarla, Fiend of the Inferno is here. Her face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. The Golden Dragon Saeva looms here, shrouded.

Narrowing your eyes, you squint off toward the east.
Amid the thriving indigo.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Pale violet flowers bloom upon a bushy indigo plant. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. A dark grey flake of plumbum sparkles upon the floor. An indigo nightfire butterfly flutters here peacefully. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Serenity cloaks the form of Orald, a battle pegasus, his posture alert and battle-ready. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. There are 4 pieces of irid moss in 4 groups here. There are 2 goldenseal roots in 2 groups here. A black cohosh root is here. There are 3 pinches of ground cinnabar in 3 groups here. A small spiky piece of gypsum crystal is partially embedded in the ground.

A bloodroot leaf lies here. A Siroccian fighting kitten rests on his haunches here. A common red admiral butterfly flits about over your head.  The soul of Zarla roams the land, bodiless. Commandant Chiam Nithilar is here. The Golden Dragon Saeva looms here, shrouded. The soul of Antidas roams the land, bodiless. Aspirant Azelhu Shu'in-Crescent is riding on a blue roan. She wields an archaic, Targossian longsword in her left hand and a saw-edged Targossian buckler in her right. The Golden Dragon Aegoth's imposing form looms. Sir Ariye Draekar Rian, Knight of the Aarash Kheyr is here, sprawled on the floor. Aodfionn Wintermourne, Herald of Redemption is here, sprawled on the floor. He wields Conquering Dawn, an aurulent broadsword in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Aurora in his right. Kitta Alexandrian is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her left hand.
Fields of indigo.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Pale violet flowers bloom upon a bushy indigo plant.  The soul of Morthif roams the land, bodiless.
Approaching Targossas (road).
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. A common red admiral butterfly flits about over your head.
Approaching the Champions' Bridge (road).
Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Resting on the ground is a cube-shaped silver sigil.
You can see no further.

Amid the thriving indigo.
The stars twinkle in the clear night sky. Pale violet flowers bloom upon a bushy indigo plant. Resplendent rays of white and gold suffuse the smooth contours of a slender glass pillar, a fervent symbol of Light's resolve. A dark grey flake of plumbum sparkles upon the floor. An indigo nightfire butterfly flutters here peacefully. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. A blue roan ambles about here, tail swishing. The shining figure of a guardian angel floats in the air here. Serenity cloaks the form of Orald, a battle pegasus, his posture alert and battle-ready. A gold-breasted falcon surveys her surroundings with an air of cool detachment. There are 6 pieces of irid moss in 6 groups here. There are 4 goldenseal roots in 4 groups here. There are 21 cohosh roots in 5 groups here. There are 3 pinches of ground cinnabar in 3 groups here. A small spiky piece of gypsum crystal is partially embedded in the ground. There are 3 pinches of ground realgar in 3 groups here. A glimmering mote of azurite lies partially buried within the ground. There are 5 pinches of ground malachite in 4 groups here. There are 14 bloodroot leaves in 5 groups here. A Siroccian fighting kitten rests on his haunches here. There are 4 kola nuts in 4 groups here.  The soul of Zarla roams the land, bodiless. Kitta Alexandrian is here. She wields a spiritual mace in her left hand. The soul of Antidas roams the land, bodiless. The soul of Azelhu roams the land, bodiless. The Golden Dragon Saeva looms here, shrouded. Commandant Chiam Nithilar is here. Legate Atalkez al'Dejan is here. Aodfionn Wintermourne, Herald of Redemption is here. He wields Conquering Dawn, an aurulent broadsword in his left hand and a Shield of Absorption bearing the arms of Aurora in his right. The Golden Dragon Aegoth's imposing form looms.
You see exits leading north, northeast, east, west, and northwest.

A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 4 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.  Melodie Ancyrion, Abaddon's Whisper lingers nearby, a lacy-white kerchief held discreetly over her nose and mouth. She wields a bronze shield inlaid with sea glass in her left hand.

Reveling in her power, Melodie beats her mighty wings, throws her massive head back, and roars a challenge as if to the world itself.
5727h, 5813m, 23800e, 22450w  exckdb---s06:15:48.55--
Melodie's head and wings flare back suddenly.
With a low rumbling from deep within her belly, Melodie utters a guttural chant. Her skin ripples as a web of crackling magical energy dances like fire across its surface, settling to solidify into a flexible, translucent shell.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 4 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  The Blue Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms.
You see a single exit leading east.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards. Zulah, Herald of Iniquity is here.
You see exits leading east, south, west, and up.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 4 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  The Blue Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 4 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  The Blue Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms.
You see a single exit leading east.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 4 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Muscles ripple beneath the shining coat of a black destrier. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. A vicious death adder is here, hood flared in warning. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.  The Blue Dragon Melodie's imposing form looms.
