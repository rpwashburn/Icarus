Report #108
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Submitted by: Anonymous      Status      : Unsubmitted
Skill       : Miscellaneous  Ability     : Paralysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Paralysis as an affliction has become so ingrained in Achaean Offense that the few classes without paralysis as an offensive hindrance are at a distinct disadvantage because they're constantly hindered by the other fighter's offense. Of course lock classes need paralysis to actually stop people from moving to be effective in their setup, but the constant hindering is an unnecessary advantage. Some classes have paralysis that is fast enough to use again on herb balance making a 1 on 1 fight nearly a passive event where the other party just suffers. We need a solution that still allows the effects of paralysis, but not being an overbearing offensive hindrance.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
change paralysis so that on the first hit, Paralysis immediately stops moving until the person eats. When the person eats the first time, the opponent can give paralysis again but the effects will not be felt for 3 seconds, giving the victim the opportunity to decide between healing strategies as well as being able to counter. To clarify, on the next paralysis, if they eat before 3 seconds from the first one, it will still be cured, if they do not, the effects will stop movement as normal.
Solution #2:
the same as solution 1 but a 5 second window
Solution #3:
the same as solution 2 except for 10 second window and that if the victim has all other afflictions for a venomlock and the opponent lands paralysis, the effects immediately go through. (Also delete Shaman and Jhui)

7.3 SIGILS


Sigils are small, magical symbols that may be attached to items, or dropped on
the ground. They have a variety of effects: a flame sigil makes an item safe
from certain attacks that try to rob you of items; a fist sigil helps you hold
on to a weapon. You may obtain sigils from city marketplaces or from one of
magi class.

For those sigils which must be attached to something, you may ATTACH <sigil> TO
<whatever>.

For fist sigils attached to a Mage's Elemental Staff, you may DETACH <sigil>
FROM <thestaff>.

Shape         Effect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fist          When ATTACHED to an item, it cannot be knocked out of your
              inventory easily. For a Mage's Elemental Staff only, may
              be detached with DETACH <sigil> FROM <staff>.

              Fist sigils are returned to you when you plant a
              quarterstaff with an attached fist sigil, or when
              you lose puppets/dolls created in arena that had
              fist sigils attached.

Monolith      When on the ground in the location you are in, this will
              prevent most forms of instant teleportation into the room.

Flame         When ATTACHED to an item, the item will not be able to be
              wielded, picked up, given away, or put anywhere. In other words,
              you will be able to drop the item, and that will be it. You
              won't be able to get it afterwards. If you don't drop the item,
              then it will be safe in your inventory insofar as no one will
              be able to order you to give it away in any manner, but you
              won't be able to give it to someone voluntarily either.

Key           The key sigil is a peculiar, and eminently useful sigil. Drop
              it in a room, and when anyone leaves that room, it will
              automatically shut and lock the doorway (if there is one) that

[File continued via MORE]
              was passed through, even if it has been locked open.

Mushroom      When ATTACHED to most objects, this sigil will cause a
              a magical explosion, annihilating both the sigil and
              whatever it was attached to.

Orb           When thrown at a chaos entity, it will destroy the entity.

Knife         When on the ground, it will periodically attempt to cut elemental
              links. Opening a single channel, or doing simultaneity, in the
              presence of a knife sigil has about a 25% chance of destroying
              the sigil.

Cube          When on the ground, it will periodically destroy vibrations,
              unless there is reverberation vibration in the room. Similarly,
              it will periodically destroy harmonics unless there is a partita
              harmonic in the room.

Eye           When on the ground, an eye sigil will prevent souls from
              entering the room. On the other hand, when thrown at the ground,
              (i.e. THROW EYE AT GROUND), an eye sigil will disappear in a
              flash of light and pull all phased people back into phase with
              reality.

9.63 Conjuration

Conjuration is the skill of creating magical items.

Creating a magical object involves three things:
1) The presence of two Ourobori.
2) Some commodities.
3) Performing a sequence of ritualistic actions.

Each ability help scroll for enchantment will show you the syntax for creating
and using that item, what commodities are required, and what actions you need
to perform.

Once you have obtained the necessary commodities, put them in one of the
ourobori (ouroboros is the singular).

To begin the conjuration process:

BEGIN CREATION OF <item>

After this, you simply have to perform the relevant actions in the proper
order. Once you've done this, type END RITUAL. If you've performed
everything properly, you will succeed. If not, you will fail, destroying your
commodities in the process.

In the AB scroll, you will see an "actions" field. These are the actions you
must perform for each item.

The actions are as follow:

1)  RING BELL
2)  CHANT <phrase> (different phrase for different products)
3)  BANG DRUM
4)  SPIN AROUND THRICE
5)  LIGHT CANDLE
6)  CLAP HANDS
7)  BURN THE POLYGON
8)  POINT SWORD
9)  BURN INCENSE
10) PLAY HORN

11) STRUM LUTE
12) FLIPCOIN
13) ROLL DICE
14) WAVE ARMS
15) CRUSH KOLA
16) WAVE FEATHER
17) SQUARE THE CIRCLE

Key:

10x12,9,3x7 = do #12 (flipcoin) 10 times, do #9 (burn incense) once, and then
do #7 (burn the polygon) 3 times.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A shimmering orb lies here, illuminating the surrounding area with a slight glow. Regal and commanding, a Dardanic stallion watches over his surroundings. A mottled Mhojave Desert falcon glides effortlessly to and fro. Upon dark, webbed wings, a small forest bat scours the area for prey. A roly-poly tiger cub romps around. A miniature snowy owl perches here, watching her surroundings with great interest. Puffing out his chest in an attempt to look tough, a young black boar eyes passers-by suspiciously. Bustling with energy, a rambunctious ferret rollicks about. Ready for battle, an armoured war pegasus stands vigilantly here. A forest wyvern lurks here, furled in leathery wings. Wings wrapped about herself, a ghost bat hangs from a nearby perch. A Baalzadeen demon towers over you, filling you with dread.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
You see exits leading east, south, west, and up.
