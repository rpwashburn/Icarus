Created by Phaestus and given a soul by Proteus in return for Phaestus's eternal loyalty, dwarves are doughty and loyal humanoids. Grouped in clans from the central Siroccian Mountains to Inbhir Ness in the far north and the Vasnari Mountains of Meropis, they prefer the relative solitude of the highlands to the hustle and bustle of cities. Nevertheless, they are often found in leadership positions as everyone has heard the maxim: dependable as a dwarf.

Dwarves are unmistakably stocky, with muscular builds that retain their strength even into extreme old age. Skinny or slender dwarves are very rare. Most stand around four feet short, though there are rare cases of giant dwarves who grow to reach human height. Their skin tone is naturally pale or ruddy, but those with tanned and dark skin are not unheard of, and their facial features are rounded, often with button or bulbous noses. Beards are prevalent among male dwarves, and most consider a long, thick beard to be a mark of pride. Many of the females can grow beards as well, though they have a tendency to remove their facial hair. Red or dark hair is very common, though blond is not particularly unusual, and it is generally thick and/or curly in texture. The eyes, too, are typically dark (brown or black) but many have blue, green, or grey eyes as well.

(see also HELP ARTEFACTS, HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS, HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for
the owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone
else's inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell
them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.
