A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 2 blood steeds here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. A purple crystal of calamine is here. A pellet of arsenic sits on the floor.  Jarrod Lucoster is here. He wields a shield of arcing lightning in his left hand and a whip of taming in his right.
You see a single exit leading east.

From   : Taraus Bravi'os
To     : Everyone
Subject: The plague, and the disease.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


A terror plagues the waters of Sapience.

That terror will be your salvation.

Beginning next month, we will begin the purge. All infected mainland harbours on the coasts of Sapience will be cleansed of the plague that has diseased our ports, and vessels.

Once the vats are burning, two days will the harbour undergo the cleansing process. Once begun, it cannot be interrupted, interfered with, stopped, nor hindered in any fashion. Vessels moving in and out of the harbour will not affect the process. Vessels docked in the harbour will not be affected by the process - it will not cure diseased ships, they will remain diseased until cured by candling or scuttling. Once the harbour is successfully cleansed, and healthy, it will remain protected from reinfection for a period of two months, but not beyond that. Any plague-carrying vessels that dock past that two-month period run the risk of reinfecting the harbour.

But even though we have the means to rid Sapience of this plague, a sickness still festers, and this one even more virulent and detestable.

The bulk of the Mariner's Guild, so-called "guardians of the seas", those valorous and upright individuals, have failed in their self-proclaimed duties. They have hidden in harbours, ensuring safety for themselves, and themselves alone. Most were unwilling to risk their ships, their crews, to fight for Sapience. They were unwilling to spend their coin, and their time, to arm themselves, and learn how to do what needed to be done. The efforts to bring together and unify ALL the captains of Sapience were met with resistance.

From the very beginning, the Mariner's Guild was rife with misinformation, and they continued to spread it. They were willing to deny and discard concrete fact and observation in favour of arrogance. They were too consumed with flinging insults in every direction -- both externally and internally -- too busy being selfish and self-serving -- too busy with petty bickering to do what needed to be done. They did, and do continue to, lie, both to outsiders, and each other. They have been frivolous with the usage of the precious cure, of which there is so very little -- including going so far as to sell it, to use it for personal gain - a level of profiteering not even the pirates would stoop to. The Mariners have secured at -least- fifteen tangles amongst them - three harbours' worth; how many do they actually still hold? And are they willing to share it with a continent in need?

There have been a precious few worthy individuals, both within and without, their ranks who have selflessly stepped up to aide the cause, alongside me and mine. Not only do they have my gratitude, but that of captains everywhere. They know who they are, and they will not be forgotten.

To the rest of Sapience - once the mainland has been purged of the plague, it will be your responsibility to keep it clean. If you have an infected vessel, then it is your duty to see it cleansed. You know who to contact if you need help. The waters northeast of Tasur'ke will remain violence-free. Those vessels anchored there will fly one of two flags -- an unmarked black flag will designate a plagued vessel awaiting a cure, an unmarked white flag will designate a vessel undergoing diagnostics, or a cure.

With the mainland cleaned, we will turn our focus to the outlying islands. Those who still wish to support the endeavour know who to contact. Those who attempt to stand in the way, or otherwise interfere, will be dealt with accordingly.

A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 2 blood steeds here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 2 blood steeds here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. A purple crystal of calamine is here. A pellet of arsenic sits on the floor.  Jarrod Lucoster is here. He wields a shield of arcing lightning in his left hand and a whip of taming in his right.
You see a single exit leading east.

A winged fire serpent tells you, "Dartega has departed my location."
The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. An obsidian eye sigil is here. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
You see exits leading east, south, west, and up.

A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 2 blood steeds here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. A purple crystal of calamine is here. A pellet of arsenic sits on the floor.  Jarrod Lucoster is here. He wields a shield of arcing lightning in his left hand and a whip of taming in his right.
You see a single exit leading east.
A winged fire serpent tells you, "Dartega has arrived at my location."

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. There are 2 blood steeds here. Like a mountain against the wind, a storm bull is standing here, motionless. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. A purple crystal of calamine is here. A pellet of arsenic sits on the floor.  Jarrod Lucoster is here. He wields a shield of arcing lightning in his left hand and a whip of taming in his right.
You see a single exit leading east.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. A purple crystal of calamine is here. A pellet of arsenic sits on the floor.  Jarrod Lucoster is here. He wields a shield of arcing lightning in his left hand and a whip of taming in his right.
You see a single exit leading east.

19.10.2 Offensive Artefacts

(see also HELP ARTEFACTS, HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS, HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for the
owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone else's
inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.


-------------------
OFFENSIVE ARTEFACTS
-------------------
Within the Offensive artefact category, we have two sub-categories:

Enhanced weapons
   - These are weapons with stats that are superior to the
     statistically average weapon of that type.

Special weapons
   - These are offensive artefacts whose advantage is not based in the
     three weapon statistics (damage, to-hit, and speed).

   - With your blade in your hand, "ATTACH BAND TO SWORD" to convert it
     into an artefact weapon, adding an additional 5%/10%/15% speed and
     damage. This also makes the weapon reset to its owner.
   - These may be DETACHed as well.
   - Blademaster swords are not able to take on the Asp add-on.

Bows:  These shoot more quickly, do more damage, and hit more easily than a
       darkbow. The damage and to-hit percentages aren't possible to give
       because they are only one of many factors - suffice it to say that
       the more expensive bows are more accurate and do more damage.

  Note: The base price of bows is based on having the DARKBOWS ability.
        Should you not have this class ability, you can purchase the
        "shooting" option via the ARTEFACT command, which grants the
        owner the ability to use the SHOOT command:
           SHOOT <adventurer> <direction> -or-
           SHOOT <adventurer> WITH METEOR.

Asp

[File continued via MORE]
For 750 credits, you may add the Asp ability to almost any artefact edged
weapon. This is achieved via ARTEFACT <item> ADD ASP.

The Asp ability causes the weapon to hit with a random venom each time, and 1/3
of the time no specific venom message is given. If there are venoms on the
weapon, the venoms will be delivered and the asp will not take effect. If there
are no venoms, asp will take effect.

For the purposes of adding Asp ability, knuckles do not count as edged weapons.

The asp ability may be traded in. It is valued at two-thirds (500 credits).

Special Weapons
---------------
Armbands of the Fist
   - These armbands allow Tekura users to hit more often with their punches
     and kicks. The precise effect is difficult to express, but is similar
     to raising the to-hit of a weapon by 10%, 15% or 20%. This effect is
     not limited by the type of target in any way, denizen or adventurer.

   Bronze Armband of the Fist   Raises to-hit by 10%   200 credits
   Copper Armband of the Fist   Raises to-hit by 15%   500 credits
   Steel Armband of the Fist    Raises to-hit by 20%  1000 credits

Boomerangs: 450 credits
   - Throw these at someone in your line of sight (up to 10 rooms away) and
     the boomerang will try to bring your target to you. The syntax is:
     THROW BOOMERANG AT <target> <direction>
   * one-way exits will defeat boomerangs.

A guardhouse (indoors).
A rune resembling a horse has been sketched into the ground here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. Eyes flickering briefly from out of a bone hilt, this daegger appears to be alive and hovers close to its master's side. There are 3 large domesticated ants here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. A black cobra resides here, flaring its hood. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare. Standing still as a statue, a blood steed has fixed its fiery red eyes on some movement in the distance. There are 2 magnesium chips in a group here. A purple crystal of calamine is here. A pellet of arsenic sits on the floor.  Jarrod Lucoster is here. He wields a shield of arcing lightning in his left hand and a whip of taming in his right.
