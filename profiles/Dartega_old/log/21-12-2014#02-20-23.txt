Composed by: Qwindor on or about the 11th of Valnuary, 614 AF.

If you are reading this then you are curious about the achaean crowdmap.
The Achaean crowdmap is a map that is mainly updated and maintained by
me, Qwindor. It is probably the most up to date map for the mudlet
client other than probably some personal maps of those who prefer to map
themselves which is always a choice you may have later on if you decide
to do as such.

But first you need to download and install the IRE mapping script via
this website:
http://wiki.mudlet.org/w/IRE_mapping_script

After you have uninstalled the old mapping script via the package
manager go ahead and install the new mapping script also via the package
manager. Once it has been installed you need to completely close down
mudlet and restart it so you can properly access all your configuration
options for the mapping script.

Once that is done then its time to configure your script to use the
crowdmap by using the command "mconfig crowdmap true" which will tell
the script to use the crowdmap instead of Achaea's "offical" map which
is most of the time way out of date and can be quite confusing when
large changes are made to the game areas.

Note that when I update the crowdmap your script will detect it and
update it for you automatically. DO NOT use the settings menu to
redownload the map otherwise the crowdmap will be overwritten with the
offical map. If you do happen to do this use the alias "rl" and click on
the link that says force update to force an update for the crowdmap

again to correct it.

Make sure your mudlet is as up to date as possible as some times the map
may not show updates that I have done purely because of the mudlet
script inside mudlet itself changing the way the map behaves and I try
to stay on top of mudlet updates when I can. Also any major out of
release changes that are done to mudlet are usually posted via this
clans newsboard so keep an eye on it as well just in case.

Now if you find mistakes in the crowdmap or PUBLIC areas I have missed
please contact me with where to find the missing rooms and I will try to
get it updated as soon as possible for me to do so. There are a few ways
you may contact me. You may contact me via messages which I prefer that
way if I'm busy I can go back to my messages and take a look at them.
You may also contact me via skype at: qwindor.rousseau but please let me
know who your in game character is and why you are adding me so as I
know who are and can confirm you in game. Otherwise enjoy the fruits of
my labor and enjoy the game made easier just because you can see where
in the hell you are going.

If you have personal areas like a subdivision house or out of
subdivision house I am able to add those to the crowdmap as well as they
for some reason are supported via GMCP which the mapping script mainly
works off of so you don't get lost as easily.

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
This enormous gatehouse is carved directly into the side of the mountain. Jagged stone walls reflect what little light is projected from the torches set between each archer slit. Racks holding weapons and several large, stone shelves filled with arrows line the eastern side of the room. Broken, discarded weapons are strewn across the floor, as though they were tossed there with great haste. A sprig of mistletoe has been hung here. There are 5 infernal wraiths here. There are 2 monolith sigils in 2 groups here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A stone gargoyle flies overhead on leathery, grey wings. Weaving in an infinity loop with wings beating soundlessly, a winged fire serpent eyes his surroundings with a menacing stare.
You see a single exit leading west.
