Subject: A Fleet of Toothpicks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 It is a little known fact that the early spring upon Sapience also heralds the mating season of the shraymor. These strange, deep sea dwellers become especially active around this time, the males territorial, indulging in grand displays of power out in the deep, dark, untouched reaches of the ocean, while the females seek... company.

Which of the sexes the sailors of Sapience came across in the early days of Aeguary was not determined, despite their repeated proximity to the creature. In a demonstration of great, perhaps misguided, tenacity, the captains threw themselves, their crew, and their ships at what came to be known as the Terror of the Eastern Coast.

Lonely or perhaps just angered, the shraymor lingered near harbour mouths, calling out and rollicking in the shallow offshore waters when the pirates and mariners retreated. Whether it was for repairs, or to find replacements for the vessels lost and the crews who had lost their heart for the chase, it waited.

Nary an ocean-goer was safe that month as it sought out and cavorted around the great wooden hulls as they sliced through the waves, dancing amidst a celebratory hail of ballista fire. Finally, as the splintered litter of the shraymor's four day revelry washed up against the shore between Shastaan and Riparium, the captains agreed to retire. Defeated, Ruth, Kinilan, Artanis, and their crews headed despondently to salvage their sundered fleet, their foe's final call ringing in their ears as it made for sanctuary amidst the distant, eastern chops.

SUMMARY: A seamonster terrorised ships off the Eastern Shore.

Submitted by: Mizik          Status      : Submitted
Skill       : Curses         Ability     : Peace
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:
Shaman combat is a spectator sport for the victim. Alternating peace and paralysis at nearly twice the speed of herb balance, all while stacking haemophilia + bleed, on top of lock afflictions. It's uncombatable by anything other than slow prep or Piety.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solution #1:
Remove Peace from Curses.
Solution #2:
Turn Peace to Pacifism. If not already done, hostile action no longer removes Pacifism from target.
