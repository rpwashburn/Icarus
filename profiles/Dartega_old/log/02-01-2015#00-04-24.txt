5714h, 5639m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
I do not recognise anything called that here.
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Before two towering mountains (road).
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A decaying corpse has been impaled here upon a fifteen foot stake. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground.  Dread Emissary Ayoxele, Thrall of Kelandra is here, shrouded. He wields a wicked-looking daegger in his left hand.
You see exits leading north, southwest, and up.
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
What do you wish to wield?
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
I do not recognise anything called that here.
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "Getting p tired may hit the sack."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "I can't believe I said hit the sack, I think I'm more tired than I thought."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
You tell Dread Emissary Ayoxele, Thrall of Kelandra, "Ok but when will you go to sleep."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "Lmao."
5714h, 5639m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "Lmao."
5714h, 5639m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "This guy."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
You tell Dread Emissary Ayoxele, Thrall of Kelandra, "I was thinking about quitting my day job."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "Night baby."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
You tell Dread Emissary Ayoxele, Thrall of Kelandra, "Night."
5714h, 5629m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele tells you, "Plz dont."
5714h, 5619m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
Ayoxele grows still and his lips begin to move silently.
5714h, 5619m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
You begin to wield a living vodun doll of Ayoxele in your right hand.
5714h, 5639m, 24875e, 22205w  exckdb----
You laugh darkly and squint at Ayoxele as you add some final touches to your doll of him.
You quickly sneak in another fashion.
5714h, 5606m, 24873e, 22195w  eckdb----
A living vodun doll of Ayoxele, its chest heaves a bit and its arms and legs move. Every detail of it is perfectly rendered, though the look in its eyes betrays no intelligence. It is a tool, not a fully living creature.
It has 11 months of usefulness left.
The doll looks to have been fashioned 74 times.
It weighs about 2 pounds and 0 ounce(s).
It bears the distinctive mark of Dartega.

An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A box lantern of thin red parchment lights the surroundings with cheerful images of Logosmas. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground.

The gates of Mhaldor.
A noxious, red-hued fog overwhelms the area with a thick, palpable vapour. Everything about you is obscured by a heavy fog. Some graffiti has been scrawled here. It reads, "Know ye that there is no truth greater than Evil." There are 5 knights of the Maldaathi here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the regulations of Mhaldor etched upon its face. An occupied iron gibbet, suspended from a wooden gallows, creaks ominously in the breeze. A ladder of long, soft leaves comprises a wispy Weaver's Fern along the ground. An enormous slab of volcanic obsidian towers over this area, the laws of Mhaldor etched upon its face. The broken fragments of a basalt altar litter the ground around the massive form of a bloodsteel stalagmite. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A box lantern of thin red parchment lights the surroundings with cheerful images of Logosmas. A brightly coloured jack-in-the-box rests quietly on the ground. Cracked rock surrounds a sulphurous fissure recently rent in the stony earth.  A huge statue of the Scimitar of Yen-Sorte stands here, thrusting skywards.
You see exits leading east, south, west, and up.
