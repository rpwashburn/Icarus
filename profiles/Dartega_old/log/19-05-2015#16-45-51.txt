A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.
You see a single exit leading west.

 [An excerpt taken from the Executive Officer's log of The Ilythian Whisper, found washed ashore near Riparium.]


Ero, 683 AF.

The sickly sweet smell of pestilence hung in the air, lingering on one's tongue. Lanterns hung from the aft of ships abandoned, their decks and railings crusted with vomit and blackened suppurate, canvas wicks burning low and fast in the absence of care. The odd corpse or two floated about in the surf, bloated and swollen beyond all discerning, the sea about its grave visage tinged a terrible yellow hue.

"Captain, there's not a bloody chance we can dock there. The moorings are full o' plagueboats."

He swore, loudly. The profanities washed about the silent docks, breaking upon a blue man's cough and sputter elsewhere in its midst.

The larders were empty. They'd taken to eating the mice. Every port was closed - the plague'd taken them all, and to dock beside or downwind was suicide. May as well hang one's self from the nest.

It came low and quiet, at first. A few bodies washed up along eastern shores. Soldiers with limbs missing and the plague's collar about their necks in full swing. The gulls had come after; the horde of curious lubbers that'd poked and pried and spread the contagion about themselves. Nay, not the disease itself, but the godsdamned curiosity about it.

Curiosity's ever a fickle thing, but she soon struck her mark. Umbrin. The plague had all but ravaged those poor blighters. A Nereian had docked there and found out the hard way. The authority'd caught on quick. Sent up mates to bar the harbour and let the Umbrinites languish in their misery. Nobody even knows if any are left, now. The plague might've taken them all. Gods knows it's bloody bad enough. S'all lost now, how the plague even came about. A raid, or somesuch. It doesn't matter, anyhow. One of the gulls broke his own ship from quarantine at the same dock later on thinking it was naught but a harmless cough, overworked sailors, mayhap. It's everywhere now.


Phaestian, 683 AF.

The cure's made and waiting, but there's not enough. Never enough of it. Mariners tell us you have to dandy with the source of the sickness, a thing called a "sargassum", a great tangle o' seaweed that pulls along the dead of the deeps in its snarls, gives them the terrible ill that makes them come alive again. A strand of the stuff and a bunch of bark and root, and the Baarian apothecary up at Tasur'ke gives you a candle to burn on deck. The fumes quell the plague, but you can just breath in a lungful o' the contagion and catch it anew. And so many have. So, so many.

Every crew that comes within firing distance of the plagueweed gets the disease themselves, a bloody awful one at that. Cursed men take the lines and helm on those brave ships in the plagued fleets, fighting both themselves and the sargassum for a chance at seeing their families outside of a casket. It's not enough, though. They get a strand when the thing finally rescinds to the deep broken and dead, but the strand's just enough for them and their mates. Seems almost pointless to fight. Three o' the pieces makes a vat enough to purge a harbour's curse, but not the ships in them. It's a nightmare. Enough so that there's talk of the Pirates of Meropis?thrice cursed, those scurvy lot, are working with Nereian and Guildsman alike to see the oceans through this storm. Them and their gypsy Pirate King.

Some of us are starting to wonder, mayhap, if there might be more dead to scuttled ships and hulls ablaze than the plague yet. We can't let this sickness get in land. If it does, we're all done for. Each plagueweed that surfaces might yet be the last, and we've no bloody clue as to how many of the things are even left, if any at all. We don't know how much time we have, or if we'll even run out.

I'm no religious man, but the Seagod's silence is deafening. And maybe soon, ours will be too.

Bar the sound of the plaguedman's cough before he tumbles over into the deeps, one last time.

Subject: Maleficent Jubilee: Updates and Reminders
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Servants of Evil,
 
   There have been some changes regarding the Maleficent Jubilee, the joint house event, so do take note.  The most important is that the Jubilee's opening ceremonies has been moved twenty four days later to the 25th of LUPAR, 684.
 
 
   Following the opening ceremonies, a two on two ladder combat tournament will be held.  The teams will be randomized with a Legate and Insidi member on each.  Winning team of the tournament will receive 15 credits each, second place will receive 10 credits each, and third will receive 5 credits each.
 
 
   After the combat tournament, test your knowledge at the House against House trivia game.  We will be choosing up to four or five from each house to participate, first to SAY the answer aloud, with correct pronunciation will receive a point for their house.  Winning team will get a one of a kind brooch, to honour thy knowledge.
 
 
   The cook-off has been slightly modified.  Instead of having a prepared dish, we are accepting a recipe up until the opening ceremonies.  Send either myself or Revelator Kitiara your recipe.  For now, your dish should only include appearance, dropped, and examined descriptions.  We will be selecting a winner, who will receive 25 credits, with two runner-ups, who will receive 10 credits each.
 
 
   I hope to see many of you out there.  Let's represent our respective houses, grow as followers of Truth, and honour thy Master.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legates,

  A job well done on all the apparel submissions!  I will go ahead and transfer five credits to each of you that had an entry.  Please, if you did not receive your credits, contact me.  We will continue to judge over the next few months so hold tight for the announcement of the winners!

  I also would like to start probing for interest as part of the Maleficent Jubilee Legate trivia team (READNEWS MHALDOR 3309).  We are looking for four to five members to represent the Legates in this event.  The opening ceremonies will be held on the 25 of Lupar 684, following that will be the two on two combat tournament, then the House versus House trivia game.  I would guess the trivia event would land somewhere between the late 26th to the 28th of Lupar.  This is just a guess - if you wish to try and plan.  Exact times, following the opening ceremony are still up in the air.  If -you- are interested, let me know.  Any questions regarding the Jubilee, contact myself or Revelator Kitiara.

  Our annual house credit sale has just opened as well.  Continue to grow, through serving Him, we shall conquer all!

-In Strength,

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.
You see a single exit leading west.

shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for the
owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone else's
inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.


-------------------
OFFENSIVE ARTEFACTS
-------------------
Within the Offensive artefact category, we have two sub-categories:

Enhanced weapons
   - These are weapons with stats that are superior to the
     statistically average weapon of that type.

Special weapons
   - These are offensive artefacts whose advantage is not based in the
     three weapon statistics (damage, to-hit, and speed).

Created by Phaestus and given a soul by Proteus in return for Phaestus's eternal loyalty, dwarves are doughty and loyal humanoids. Grouped in clans from the central Siroccian Mountains to Inbhir Ness in the far north and the Vasnari Mountains of Meropis, they prefer the relative solitude of the highlands to the hustle and bustle of cities. Nevertheless, they are often found in leadership positions as everyone has heard the maxim: dependable as a dwarf.

Dwarves are unmistakably stocky, with muscular builds that retain their strength even into extreme old age. Skinny or slender dwarves are very rare. Most stand around four feet short, though there are rare cases of giant dwarves who grow to reach human height. Their skin tone is naturally pale or ruddy, but those with tanned and dark skin are not unheard of, and their facial features are rounded, often with button or bulbous noses. Beards are prevalent among male dwarves, and most consider a long, thick beard to be a mark of pride. Many of the females can grow beards as well, though they have a tendency to remove their facial hair. Red or dark hair is very common, though blond is not particularly unusual, and it is generally thick and/or curly in texture. The eyes, too, are typically dark (brown or black) but many have blue, green, or grey eyes as well.

The rajamala are a race of proud, fierce, tiger-like humanoids from a distant planet. The first that history speaks of the rajamala is when they fought with the Triumvirate, under the command of the god Agatheis, during the great battle on Nishnatoba. Their origins are not known. They mingle easily with the other races and seldom form communities of their own, though one village in the valley of Xhaiden Dale is comprised mostly of rajamala.

Orange fur with black stripes is the traditional colouring of rajamala, but many have coats that mimic that of other felines: tawny and golden, white, black, silver, and more. They may also be spotted or striped in many combinations. Rajamala stand six feet tall on average, with a sleek or muscular physique that seldom becomes overweight. Their eyes are often amber or yellow and brown, but they can be blue and green and black as well. They are born with tails, and some have manes and whiskers that can be styled like human hair.

19.10.2 Offensive Artefacts

(see also HELP ARTEFACTS, HELP ARTEFACT TRADEINS, HELP ARTEFACT TRANSFERS)

Artefacts are special items that can be purchased only with Bound Credits.
Unless otherwise stated, artefacts can be purchased in Merentesh's series of
shops in Delos. They will reset into your inventory frequently, which means
they cannot be loaned out, or stolen(!), for very long. Some only work for the
owner. They never decay. They cannot be changed to reset to anyone else's
inventory, so do not buy artefacts of any kind if you intend to sell them.


Note About Stacking
-------------------
Artefact effects (for similar artefacts) don't combine or stack. If you have,
say, a Collar of Ceylon and a Collar of Agatheis, then only one will boost
damage of a magical nature. If you have a Logosian Ring and a Mayan Ring, then
only one will increase the value of sipping a health elixir. In general, the
best item rules, but there may be exceptions. So don't count on having two
artefacts and somehow stacking their effects.


-------------------
OFFENSIVE ARTEFACTS
-------------------
Within the Offensive artefact category, we have two sub-categories:

Enhanced weapons
   - These are weapons with stats that are superior to the
     statistically average weapon of that type.

Special weapons
   - These are offensive artefacts whose advantage is not based in the
     three weapon statistics (damage, to-hit, and speed).

   - With your blade in your hand, "ATTACH BAND TO SWORD" to convert it
     into an artefact weapon, adding an additional 5%/10%/15% speed and
     damage. This also makes the weapon reset to its owner.
   - These may be DETACHed as well.
   - Blademaster swords are not able to take on the Asp add-on.

Bows:  These shoot more quickly, do more damage, and hit more easily than a
       darkbow. The damage and to-hit percentages aren't possible to give
       because they are only one of many factors - suffice it to say that
       the more expensive bows are more accurate and do more damage.

  Note: The base price of bows is based on having the DARKBOWS ability.
        Should you not have this class ability, you can purchase the
        "shooting" option via the ARTEFACT command, which grants the
        owner the ability to use the SHOOT command:
           SHOOT <adventurer> <direction> -or-
           SHOOT <adventurer> WITH METEOR.

Asp

[File continued via MORE]
For 750 credits, you may add the Asp ability to almost any artefact edged
weapon. This is achieved via ARTEFACT <item> ADD ASP.

The Asp ability causes the weapon to hit with a random venom each time, and 1/3
of the time no specific venom message is given. If there are venoms on the
weapon, the venoms will be delivered and the asp will not take effect. If there
are no venoms, asp will take effect.

For the purposes of adding Asp ability, knuckles do not count as edged weapons.

The asp ability may be traded in. It is valued at two-thirds (500 credits).

Special Weapons
---------------
Armbands of the Fist
   - These armbands allow Tekura users to hit more often with their punches
     and kicks. The precise effect is difficult to express, but is similar
     to raising the to-hit of a weapon by 10%, 15% or 20%. This effect is
     not limited by the type of target in any way, denizen or adventurer.

   Bronze Armband of the Fist   Raises to-hit by 10%   200 credits
   Copper Armband of the Fist   Raises to-hit by 15%   500 credits
   Steel Armband of the Fist    Raises to-hit by 20%  1000 credits

Boomerangs: 450 credits
   - Throw these at someone in your line of sight (up to 10 rooms away) and
     the boomerang will try to bring your target to you. The syntax is:
     THROW BOOMERANG AT <target> <direction>
   * one-way exits will defeat boomerangs.
   * the same things that prevent a yank will prevent a boomerang from
     succeeding (impaled, massed, stand firm, rooted, clinging) plus
     grounding vibes, being at a dock, restrained by tentacles or grave
     hands, or a rite of piety.

Bracers of Flame: 400 credits
   - Grants the wielder the ability to FIRELASH and cast FIREWALLS.

Bracers of Frost: 1000 credits
   - Allows you to:
        1) FREEZE GROUND - Cover the ground in ice.

        2) FREEZE <person> - Freeze an opponent.
        3) CAST DEEPFREEZE - Deepfreeze all your enemies that are in the
           same location with you, if you could otherwise interact with
           that person (taking into account astralform, phase,
           blackwind, and the like).
        4) POINT <bracers> <direction> - Create an icewall to block the
           direction.

Collars:
   - These increase damage done to opponents from abilities that are
     magical in nature. These abilities include cast (or grove) lightning,
     cast firelash, thornrend, staffcast, stormhammer, accentato, holocaust
     globe, kai choke, distort aura, utter truename, warp, taint, purity,
     decay, star tarot, thurisaz rune, educe iron, and mind crush.


   Collar of Ceylon        10% increased damage        400 credits
   Collar of Diablerie     15% increased damage        800 credits
   Collar of Agatheis      20% increased damage       1600 credits

Critical Hit Pendants
   - These pendants allow you to get extra critical hits when hunting.
     Everybody, at every level, has a chance of getting a critical hit.
     The higher the level, the higher the chance of getting a critical
     hit _and_ the higher the chance of getting harder hits. These
     pendants increase both the chance of getting a critical hit and
     the chance of getting harder hits. To give a couple of examples
     of critical hit chances: level 50 = 1.6% chance of getting a
     critical hit; level 65 = 6.4%; level 80 = 16.6%.

   Fire pendant              2% increased chance       200 credits
   Blood pendant             4% increased chance       600 credits
   Stygian pendant           6% increased chance      1200 credits

Metal Knuckles:
   - Increases damage: MAUL, PUNCH, JBP, HFP, HKP, UCP, & SPP

   Copper Knuckles   15% increased Tekura damage       400 credits
                     10% increased Metam. damage

     Loki venom (which hits the person with a random venom).

Silver Fangs: 600 credits

     with the silver.

18.8 Becoming an Immortal - specifically, a Celani


So you're thinking about applying to be a Celani? Well, before you do, you
probably want to know what you're getting yourself into!


BECOMING A CELANI
-----------------
Here's what's involved, if you wish to follow this path:

1 - There will be an announcement. We'll let you know when we're looking!

2 - Respond by giving your reasons in writing why you want to be a
    Celani, what it means to you, your characters' histories, etc.

3 - We'll read the applications/stories and consider. We will consider
    lots of other things too, like how long you've been around, your
    characters' reputations, positions of leadership and responsibility,
    etc. We'll also look for writing - as an immortal, you really must be
    able to write! Spelling, punctuation, usage, grammar, it's all
    important to some degree.

4 - We'll look deeper into certain candidates, likely with further
    talks, interviews, etc. There are ALWAYS more candidates than there
    are openings, so don't feel bad if you aren't asked for a further
    interview. We'll want to know if you understand exactly what you're
    getting into. We'll want to know if you are able to commit the time
    consistently to keep things going. We'll want to know if we can trust
    you.

5 - We'll invite a few to become Celani, if they are still interested.

Applicants who are not invited will not otherwise be notified, but are free to
apply another time.


A BIT OF BACKGROUND
-------------------
We have two ranks of immortality before you become a full-fledged God: Celani

A massive gatehouse (indoors).
A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. Playing endlessly with its long floppy ears, a small burro stands here quietly. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A stubborn mule wanders about here, nosing at the ground. A fierce tiger prowls restlessly nearby. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter. Wings flaring, a pegasus tosses his regal head impatiently.  Carbine Sar'vet, Initiate of the West is riding on an alabaster pegasus. He wields a bard's mandolin in his left hand and a malformed javelin in his right.
You see a single exit leading west.
