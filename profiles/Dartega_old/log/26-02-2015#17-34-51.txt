A massive gatehouse (indoors).
There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A light horse lingers here, pawing at the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. An ice-blue falcon sits here, calmly observing her surroundings. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.  Dread Legate Kuy is riding on a noble hippogriff. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a gruesome dismembered baalzadeen shield in his left hand and a living vodun doll of Aegoth in his right.

This enormous gatehouse is carved directly into the side of the mountain. Jagged stone walls reflect what little light is projected from the torches set between each archer slit. Racks holding weapons and several large, stone shelves filled with arrows line the eastern side of the room. Broken, discarded weapons are strewn across the floor, as though they were tossed there with great haste. There are 3 infernal wraiths here. A runic totem is planted solidly in the ground. A light horse lingers here, pawing at the ground. A sigil in the shape of a small, rectangular monolith is on the ground. A midnight blue draught horse stands patiently awaiting direction. Snorting softly, a dappled grey destrier lingers in regal repose. An ice-blue falcon sits here, calmly observing her surroundings. There are 2 noble hippogriffs here. Playfully scampering about is a sleek black otter.  Dread Legate Kuy is riding on a noble hippogriff. His face is partially concealed beneath a raised hood. He wields a gruesome dismembered baalzadeen shield in his left hand and a living vodun doll of Aegoth in his right.
You see a single exit leading west.
